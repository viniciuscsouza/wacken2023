Als Anfang der 80er Jahre ein Haufen Jugendlicher ihren Idolen aus Großbritannien und Kalifornien nacheiferte, hätte wohl niemand damit gerechnet, dass daraus eine Szene werden würde, die bis heute immer größer wird. Das Ruhrgebiet ist nach wie vor das Zentrum des deutschen Metals. Nicht nur Kreator, Sodom, Grave Digger, Rage, Axel Rudi Pell &amp; Co. haben hier ihre Wurzeln, sondern auch die Plattenlabels Drakkar und Century Media oder das Rock Hard Magazin. Das Buch „Kumpels in Kutten“ erzählt die Geschichte dieser einzigartigen Szene von den 80er Jahren bis in die Gegenwart.<\/p>\r\n<p>Holger Schmenk und Andreas Schiffmann (u.a. Rock Hard) arbeiten zurzeit am dritten Band von Kumpels in Kutten, der im Herbst 2023 erscheinen soll, und interviewen quer durch die Metal-Szene Musiker, Label-Chefs, Produzenten &amp; Co., denn seit 2010 bzw. 2017 hat sich einiges getan ...<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Die Autoren:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Holger Schmenk , Dr. phil.<\/strong>, Historiker, wurde 1978 in Oberhausen geboren und lebt inzwischen in der Nähe von Marburg.

Nach Zwischenstation als Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter an den Universitäten Duisburg-Essen und Siegen arbeitet er aktuell als Schulleiter. Seit 2008 beschäftigt er sich als Autor mit der Metal-Szene im Ruhrgebiet, woraus „Kumpels in Kutten“ hervorging.<\/p>\r\n<p>Der gebürtige Saarländer <strong>Andreas Schiffmann<\/strong> ist Magister Artium der Germanistik und Anglistik, studierter Journalist sowie Bürokaufmann, dem niemand seine Buchhaltung anvertrauen sollte.

The result perfectly captures the live energy and the old school character that defines the band without neglecting the strengths of a modern, compact soundscape. Riff-fests like ‘Vultures‘ and ‘Kill the silence‘ grab the listener by the throat and succeed with straight-ahead stomp and economical arrangements – it comes as no surprise genre legends such as João Gordo (Ratos de Porão), Rodrigo Oliveira (Korzus) and Michael Gilbert (Flotsam &amp; Jetsam) were thrilled to be studio guests!

With strong influences coming from bands of this genre’s classic school, the girls of the band seek to rescue the best in heavy music.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">In agust of 2011 Fernanda Lira took on the bass and vocals of NERVOSA, and only then, finally with the full team, the band start recording and playing shows.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">In March 2012, the band released their first music video for “Masked Betrayer,” which reached the incredible mark, for a new band, of 20,000 views in just one week, prompting them to receive an Honorable Mention from YouTube, as the 17th most watched clip of musicians of the week and 55th most viewed in the month of March of that year.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">Thanks to the notoriety gained through their hard work, NERVOSA in the following months, achieved a great accomplishment: the contract with the Austrian label Napalm Records, which has in their roster names like Cavalera Conspiracy, WASP, Grave Digger, Moonspell, Huntress, among many others.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">Still in 2012, the band’s first record, a demo with 3 tracks, was released in Brazil on CD independently, under the title ‘2012’ in August, and abroad by Napalm Records on turquoise vinyl, and by Nuclear Blast in a clear version, both under the title ‘Time Of Death’, whose cover art was designed by artist Andrei Bouzikov, who has worked with several bands previously, such as Municipal Waste.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">Nervosa ends the year 2012 with a very positive balance with more than 50 concerts made around the country, among them, sharing the stage with bands like Exodus, Raven, Grave, Samael (in the festival Roça n Roll), Exumer and Artillery , among others.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">After a period of exchanging drummers, the one who assumed the position in February of 2013 was Pitchu Ferraz.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">Thus, the year 2013 began with a renewed vibe, and the band continued to promote their EP throughout the country, with shows in several states, and even a tour over<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">the North and Northeast of the country, as well as sharing the stage with other great Names of the world scene such as Korzus, Ratos de Porão and also Destruction, Exciter, Blaze Bayley, Kreator, DRI And Benediction.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">In 2014, the girls finished the recording of their first full lenght, titled Victim of Yourself, which had 12 tracks and whose cover was signed again by the artist Andrei Bouzikov, and the booklet was produced by the Brazilian artist Rafael Romanelli.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">The album was released in March of that same year by Napalm Records in Europe and North America, and by other record companies and distributors in South America, Japan and Russia. In addition to the traditional CD format, 4 vinyl versions were also released – in black, blue, red and clear colors, distributed by Napalm Records itself and also by Nuclear Blast.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">Two clips were released throughout the album’s promotion: ‘Death!’, which achieved record-breaking views among the band’s videos (over 1 million views), and ‘Into Moshpit’, a live video compilation that demonstrates all the energy of the girls in a live show.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">These two singles, added to the other tracks of the album, made ‘Victim of Yourself’ reach great response from the metal audience, as well as prominence and good ratings in major magazines in the segment around the world, such as European Metal Hammer, Rock Hard , Terrorizer and Bass Guitar, the American Revolver and Guitar World and even the Japanese Burrrn, as well as the Brazilian Roadie Crew, Bass Player, Guitar Player and Modern Drummer magazines.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">The good reception of the album was essential to result in a long and intense tour that lasted for the years 2014 and 2015. To promote the album in Brazil, the band played in Brazilian 17 states, went through 7 countries in Latin America and made a successful European tour with 51 shows in 60 days, including a total of 16 countries in the continent, including performances at some of Europe’s biggest summer festivals such as Summerbreeze, Brutal Assault, Metal Days, Obscene Extreme, among others.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">The ‘Victim of Yourself’ promotion tour also took the band to the United States for the first time in 2016. Starting with two presentations on the already traditional ‘70000 tons of metal’ cruise, leaving from Florida and going to Jamaica, the tour also passed through much of the West Coast of the country and also to the South, with more than 30 concerts from the state of Washington all the way to the state of Florida. In addition, other new territories were explored by Nervosa, such as Mexico, where the band toured for two weeks, and other locations such as Puerto Rico and Peru.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">In 2016, the band recorded their new album, titled ‘Agony’. Recorded and produced in the states of California and Oregon in the United States by Brendan Duffey and<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">mixed and mastered by thrash master Andy Classen, the album had its world premiere announced for June 3 by the Austrian label Napalm Records.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">This same year was also very intense regarding shows to promote their latest album: there were more than 160 shows only in 2016.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">‘Agony’ promotion tours include a European summer tour with almost 50 dates, a full month of shows on the US East Coast and also in Canada, as well as two European tours as special guests of the German band Destruction for a total of almost 60 shows, part of them being alongside the great bands Flotsam &amp; Jetsam and Enforcer.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">In 2017, who officially takes over the drums of the band is the competent Luana Dametto, who then played on 2 major European tours (with Destruction and, later on, Venom Inc. and Suffocation) and also on the ‘World in Agony Tour’ which passed through Europe in the summer of 2017 and also whole Latin America.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">In June 2018, the band released their new album “Downfall of Mankind”, via Napalm Records and did many tours in Europe, Latin America and Asia. The album was highly acclaimed by critics and in 2019 they played at Rock in Rio in front of than 70 thousand people.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">In 2020 the band split up and announced the new lineup with Diva Satanica (Bloodhunter) on vocals, Mia Wallace on bass (Abbath, Triumph of Death, among others), and Eleni Nota on drums (Mask of Prospero and Croque Madame).<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv4144006957ydpbb8acaf7p5\">The band released the single “Guided By Evil”, the new album “Perpetual Chaos” will be released in January 2021.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/nervosa\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kweVT4X6PDM","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"nervosa-2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/nervosa-2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27097}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1952,"uri":"http:\/\/www.nervosaofficial.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1953,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/femalethrash\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":1954,"uri":"https:\/\/instawidget.net\/v\/user\/nervosathrash"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"5D9d9xyLNQu32QVD9t4YqH","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/5\/8\/csm_nervosa-2023_7b45375fac.jpg","uid":694}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Brasilien","uid":29}],"pathSegment":"nervosa","title":"Nervosa","uid":280}],"end":"1690981200","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691024400","start":"1690956000","title":"Wednesday","uid":13},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1690977600","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":859},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"holy-moses","pid":176,"title":"Holy Moses","uid":580},"biography":"<p>Holy Moses are a household name within the international metal scene. Their multi-faceted thrash metal, front-woman Sabina Classen’s charismatic voice and their unique mix of traditional attitude and experimental evolvement have been instrumental in establishing the band as a well-known and reliable entity since the beginning of their career in the early 1980’s.<\/p>\r\n<p>Their latest studio-release Redefined Mayhem from 2014 was a prime example of an album which expertly blends past and present. “Holy Moses have never released standard thrash songs, and we never will,” Sabina Classen explains with some pride. “We write songs which we like ourselves and don’t compromise in terms of trends and concessions to wrong expectations. We don’t have to please everybody, we’re our own brand, we have our own sound, which includes the occasional odd beat, technically demanding passages and unusual chord structures as well as interesting lyrics which deal with the dark side of people and their minds.”<\/p>\r\n<p>That Holy Moses don’t show any symptoms of fatigue is mainly due to their perfect balance within their line-ranks, consisting of founding members and musicians who have previously also played in other groups: Frontwoman Sabina Classen has been the voice and face of Holy Moses since 1981, bassist Thomas Neitsch has been in the band since 2008, drummer Gerd Lücking joined the fold with guitarist Peter Geltat in 2011\/2012. This line-up has proved to be ambitious and ready to face the new challenges in a permanently evolving metal genre.<\/p>\r\n<p>“This is Holy Moses. In 2022\/2023 we will define a new chapter of our band history,” explains Sabina Classen, adding: “The band has been growing together as a very strong team for more than 10 years by now. The new album, which is due to come out in 2023, is in the mixing process right now and will show that Holy Moses continues to be a force to be reckoned with. We cannot reveal much more right now, but look out for further news coming soon!”. 2023 is set to be a very special year for Holy Moses with a strong and comprehensive live campaign…<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/holy-moses\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f-gR8UUakAg","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"holy_moses_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/holy_moses_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27390}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2182,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/official.holy.moses"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2183,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/holy.moses.official\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"7jcSmabVYrhiPf8mY1P0OV","subtitle":"Last German Open Air Show","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/c\/c\/csm_holy_moses_2023_53465fb78b.jpg","uid":750}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"holy-moses","title":"Holy Moses","uid":580}],"end":"1690987500","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691024400","start":"1690956000","title":"Wednesday","uid":13},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1690983900","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":860},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"battle-beast","pid":176,"title":"Battle Beast","uid":43},"biography":"<p>“100% heavy metal - 0% bullshit!” - BATTLE BEAST’s formula is simple, but very effective; and with their enormously catchy, riff-laden songs coupled with Noora Louhimo’s unique voice, these young Finns have become a flagship of modern heavy metal over the past few years.<\/p>\r\n<p>Having only formed in 2008, BATTLE BEAST went on to win the Wacken Metal Battle in 2010 and signed a record detail with the renown German metal label Nuclear Blast. The unleashing of their acclaimed debut »Steel« (2012), won the band a support slot for their labelmates NIGHTWISH. Frontwoman Noora Louhimo finally joined the band in 2012 and the band’s self-titled record (2013) was released shortly afterwards. BATTLE BEAST then got the opportunity to open for bands such as SONATA ARCTICA and POWERWOLF on extensive runs. Their ascent up the metal ladder was quick and the band’s 3<sup>rd<\/sup> studio album »Unholy Savior«, achieved remarkable chart positions all over Europe (#1 Finland, #23 UK Rock, #39 Germany etc.). This release was accompanied by another big European tour, but this time with Swedish heavy metal heroes SABATON and DELAIN. BATTLE BEAST’s very first headline run throughout the Continent rounded off their »Unholy Savior« touring cycle.<\/p>\r\n<p>But the band didn’t rest on their well-deserved laurels and instead made 2017 the most successful year in their still rather short history by forging their 4<sup>th<\/sup> powerful piece of heavy metal, »Bringer Of Pain«. The record also marked BATTLE BEAST’s first output without their original songwriter Anton Kabanen. The achievements of the previous album were topped: #1 in Finland, #14 in Germany plus several entries in countries where they had never hit the album charts before. The band’s 2<sup>nd<\/sup>European headlining trek, this time supported by MAJESTY and GYZE, was the cherry on the 2017 cake. Many shows were sold out and had to be moved to bigger venues! Appearances at festivals such as Bloodstock Open Air (UK), Summer Breeze (D), and Masters of Rock (CZ) and show debuts in various countries and continents faded out this year which went down in history.<\/p>\r\n<p>Enough has been said, back to the present! In April 2018, BATTLE BEAST is going on another US tour with KAMELOT and DELAIN, before performing at selected summer festivals and playing a couple of club shows in between.

Wo andere sich noch in farbigen Beschreibungen verlieren, hat die Band schon den nächsten Gang eingelegt und spielt sich mit voller Kraft mitten ins „Heart Of The Hurricane“. Der Titel des dritten Albums ist Status quo und Versprechen zugleich, Ergebnis der vergangenen zwei Jahre und Aufbruchsstimmung, die mal so richtig Vorfreude auf die kommenden Auftritte macht.<\/p>\r\n<p>Schon mit ihrem Debüt im Jahr 2015 schlug die Band um Sängerin Jennifer Haben ein wie eine Bombe. „Songs Of Love And Death“ hielt sich wochenlang in den Top 15 der Charts und brachte der Band den renommierten „Metal Hammer“-Award in der Kategorie „Newcomer des Jahres“ ein. Auch der Nachfolger „Lost In Forever“ konnte 2016 direkt daran anknüpfen, ging auf Platz 4 und führte Beyond The Black auf eine größtenteils ausverkaufte Mammut-Tour durch Deutschland und Großbritannien über Russland bis nach Japan. Seit 2014 begeistert die Band ihre Fans als regelmäßiger Gast auf dem Wacken Open Air und war gefeierter Support-Act für Aerosmith, Korn, die Scorpions, Saxon, Within Temptation sowie unzählige andere internationale Größen.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Auch das deutsche Fernsehen wurde auf Beyond The Black aufmerksam und so wurde „Night Will Fade“ der Titeltrack der 2017er-Sat1-Produktion „Die Ketzerbraut“, in der Frontfrau Jennifer auch mit einem kleinen CameoAuftritt überraschte.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Beyond The Black ist die Band der Extreme: Wie Naturgewalten, die ungebändigt aufeinandertreffen und die Einzelteile immer wieder neu zusammensetzen zu diesem außergewöhnlichen Sound-Crossover, mit dem die Band seit Jahren begeistert. Opulent arrangierter Symphonic Metal, filigraner Melodic Metal und mitreißender Mittelalter-Rock bilden hier eine so stimmige wie unverbrauchte Einheit, die sich in purer Energie entlädt und immer neue erschafft. Dabei seit jeher kompromisslos, denn was nicht passt, wird nicht passend gelogen, sondern neu formiert. So haben Sängerin Jennifer Haben und ihr neues Line-up bestehend aus Christian Hermsdörfer (Gitarre, Backing Vocals), Tobias Lodes (Gitarre, Backing Vocals), Stefan Herkenhoff (Bass) und Kai Tschierschky (Drums) ihre LiveFeuertaufe bereits absolut erfolgreich bestanden und sind nun erstmalig auf einem gemeinsamen Album zu hören.<\/p>\r\n<p>Dafür haben sie sich Zeit genommen, haben sich ganz in Ruhe ausprobiert, sind unbekannte Wege gegangen, haben experimentiert und der gemeinsamen Leidenschaft für ausgetüftelte Detailarbeit ihren Lauf gelassen. Und das hört man in jedem der 13 neuen Tracks, diesen frischen Wind der völlig neuen Gruppendynamik. Unter der Aufsicht des bestens bewährten Producer-Teams Sascha Paeth (Avantasia, Edguy, Epica) und Elephant Music hat die Band ab Sommer 2017 parallel in Wolfsburg und Flensburg am Album gearbeitet. „Metallische Effizienz in High-EndPräzision“, wie Sängerin Jennifer Haben mit leuchtenden Augen berichtet. „Die Arbeiten waren diesmal viel intensiver und auch produktiver als noch auf den beiden Vorgängerplatten. Die Jungs haben unglaublich viele Vorschläge ins Songwriting mit eingebracht; nach nur knapp einem Monat hatten wir schon über 30 Songideen zusammen“, aus denen Beyond The Black nach langem Feinschliff schließlich „Heart Of The Hurricane“ destillierten.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Es ist eine Bandplatte im besten Sinne des Wortes, denn man hört diese ganz besondere Einheit deutlich in jedem Ton. 2018 ist das Jahr, in dem Beyond The Black die äußersten Stilgrenzen der Extreme ausloten: Einerseits zieht man die Härteschrauben nochmal um diverse Umdrehungen an, andererseits beherrscht eine bisher in dieser Form nie dagewesene Eingängigkeit die Stücke. BTB folgen ihrem untrüglichen Gespür für packende Melodien, alles pulverisierende Blastbeats, tödliche Nackenbrecher-Riffs, epische Keyboard-Passagen sowie aufwendig arrangierte Streicher- und Chorsätze. Mit dem gewaltigen Mix aus elfengleichen Vocals und tiefkehligen Growls entsteht eine bombastische Breitwandproduktion – vom Herzen in die Finger oder „vom Herzen in die Stimmbänder“, wie es Jennifer lachend beschreibt.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Schon die Vorabsingle, der Titeltrack von „Heart Of The Hurricane“, demonstriert die Stimm- und Soundgewalt, die da auf uns zukommt. Der perfekte Soundtrack für den eigenen Neustart: „Dieses Stück existiert bereits seit mehr als vier Jahren“, erklärt Jennifer. „Bisher hat es nie so richtig gepasst, doch diesmal war die Zeit schließlich reif. Der Text spiegelt wider, was in letzter Zeit um diese Band herum passiert ist.“ Nach der umfassenden Besetzungsänderung standen die fünf im Jahr 2016 unter enormen Druck und in der Kritik einiger Die-Hard-Fans. Eine Herausforderung, die dann aber zusammenschweißte, was zusammengehört. „Wir kamen uns vor, als wären wir mitten im Auge des Orkans“, so Jennifer weiter. „Doch hat sich inmitten dieses Hurrikans in uns selbst etwas zusammengebraut, das unbedingt rausmusste und nun auf&nbsp; der neuen Platte explodiert. Wir sind am Gegenwind gewachsen und haben eine unglaublich starke Wir-gegen-den-Rest-der-Welt-Mentalität entwickelt. Wir wissen heute besser denn je, wer wir sind und was wir können. Und das wollen wir auch unseren Fans beweisen!“<\/p>\r\n<p>Von atmosphärisch-düsterer Härte („Through The Mirror“, „My God Is Dead“) spannen Beyond The Black den stilistischen Bogen über ihren markanten Metal-meets-Medieval-Sound („Scream For Me“, „Song For The Godless“) bis hin zur bittersüßen Akustikballade „Breeze“. „Uns war wichtig, eine wirklich abwechslungsreiche Platte aufzunehmen, die gleichzeitig wie aus einem Guss klingen sollte.

The initial spark was 'Lucille' by Little Richard, which ignited a fire in Doro that still burns to this day. Doro wants to conquer the world with music and make people happy. At 16 she has her first band Snakebite. Beast and Attack follow and the big breakthrough with Warlock. The debut album \"Burning The Witches\" was released in 1983 and immediately won the hearts of metal fans worldwide. A major label immediately became aware of the band and Warlock switched from Mausoleum Records to Phonogram (today Universal). After the second record \"Hellbound\" the first successful European tours followed. In the course of the third album \"True As Steel\", Doro is the first front woman at the legendary \"Monsters Of Rock\" festival in 1986 in Castle Donington, England, and is frenetically celebrated. The first mega tour with Judas Priest in Europe and W.A.S.P. in England followed. \"True As Steel\" was also the band's first worldwide release, including the USA. Since it has always been Doro's great desire to conquer the USA, she goes on a promotional tour there. After two days, Doro falls in love with New York City and stays in America.<br \/> She works on her most successful album up to that point in time, \"Triumph And Agony\", with immortal hits such as 'All We Are' and 'Für Immer'. The impressive video clips are shot by famous directors: 'All We Are' is filmed in the L.A. River Basin, where well-known scenes from 'Terminator 2' were also filmed, 'Für Immer' is impressively staged in the swamps of Louisiana. The videos caused a sensation internationally and are shown on MTV on heavy rotation in the USA, where Doro also appears as a host on several occasions. In addition, \"Triumph And Agony\" is supported by a US tour with Megadeth and a European tour with Ronnie James Dio and achieves gold status. The follow-up \"Force Majeure\", released under the name Doro, is also immediately certified gold. The accompanying singles 'A Whiter Shade Of Pale' and 'Hard Times' are again being implemented in L.A. by great film and video directors.<br \/> After that, another dream comes true for Doro as a big Kiss fan. The album \"Doro\" is produced by none other than Gene Simmons in New York and L.A.<br \/> Further productions with famous producers in Nashville, New York and New Jersey followed with \"True At Heart\", \"Angels Never Die\" and \"Machine II Machine\" and the first live album \"Doro Live\".<br \/> Then it's back to New York, where Doro works for three years on one of her favorite albums - \"Love Me In Black\". The title track turns out to be another classic in Doro's repertoire.<br \/> The following production \"Calling The Wild\" features Doro's first duet with another icon, Lemmy Kilmister from Motörhead. The friendship between the two grows so much that they tour together, perform at many festivals together, celebrate various anniversaries together and record more great duets over the years. The last one is the heartbreaking 'It Still Hurts' on Doro's album \"Raise Your Fist\". Doro also releases an elaborate work with the \"Classic Night Orchestra\" entitled \"Classic Diamonds\" and also plays an opulent headliner show at the Wacken Open Air, where she has been a guest about twenty times to date, including many headlining shows.<br \/> After many more album and DVD\/Blu-ray releases, soundtracks for film productions and the again very successful double album \"Forever Warriors - Forever United\", Doro starts her very successful own label Rare Diamonds Productions. Her releases include the German-language work \"Für Immer\", the triple album \"Magic Diamonds\", the cinema film and soundtrack \"Anuk – The Path Of The Warrior\" and the recent \"Triumph And Agony Live\".<br \/> In 2022, Doro was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award, having already received an Echo, the Metal Goddess Legend Award in Las Vegas, the Legend Award in England and Germany, the Angel Of Rock Award in England and awards as the sexiest woman alive, among others. She has also been voted Best Female Vocalist in Spain for 30 years and was inducted into the Hall Of Heavy Metal History in the United States.<br \/> Doro has given over 3,000 concerts in more than 60 countries.<br \/> She is currently working on a new album with many anthems and next year will celebrate her 40th stage anniversary at the world's biggest festivals.<br \/> At the end of the festivities, Doro will play another unforgettable concert for her fans in her old hometown in Düsseldorf, where it all started, on October 28, 2023 in the Mitsubishi Electric Halle with many friends and companions.<br \/> 2023 will be a very special year for the Queen Of Metal - Doro Pesch!<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/doro\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N9YL8MXGqNI","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"doro_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/doro_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27386}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2165,"uri":"https:\/\/www.doromusic.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2166,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DoroPeschOfficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2167,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dorometalqueen\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2168,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/doroofficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2169,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/doroschannel"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"5GLeyUhj8B8f5pJxqZllKl","subtitle":"40th Anniversary Show","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/0\/b\/csm_doro_2023_e539d6d859.jpg","uid":746}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"doro","title":"Doro","uid":576}],"end":"1691013600","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691024400","start":"1690956000","title":"Wednesday","uid":13},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691006400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"40th Anniversary Show","uid":863},{"artists":[{"assets":[],"country":[],"pathSegment":"tba","title":"TBA","uid":479}],"end":"1690969500","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691024400","start":"1690956000","title":"Wednesday","uid":13},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1408","subtitle":"","title":"Headbangers Stage","uid":7},"start":"1690968300","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"MB Denmark","uid":905},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"black-tooth","pid":176,"title":"Black Tooth","uid":645},"biography":"<p>Black Tooth is a Groove Metal band, founded 2006 in Turkey by Tuna ( Vocal ), Deniz ( Bass ) and Utku ( Drums ).<br \/> The adventure of BLACK TOOTH started with the Myspace page we opened in 2006.

music world may be in a permanent state of panic and flux, but one basic principle of rock’n’roll remains true: the key to longevity is to always deliver the goods. No band has better encapsulated this ethos of integrity and determination over the last decade than Skindred.<\/p>\r\n<p>Widely acknowledged as one of the most devastating and enthralling live bands on the planet, the Newport destroyers have been a perennial force for musical invention and remorseless positivity since emerging from the ashes of frontman Benji Webbe’s former band Dub War back in 1998. Over the course of four universally praised studio albums – Babylon (2002), Roots Rock Riot (2007), Shark Bites And Dog Fights (2009) and Union Black (2011) – Skindred’s reputation for producing the ultimate spark-spraying state-of-the-art soundclash, combining all manner of seemingly disparate musical elements into an irresistibly exhilarating explosion of energy and cross-pollinated cultural fervour has rightly earned them a reputation as a band capable of uniting people from all corners of the globe and making every last one of them tear up the dancefloor with a giant shit-eating grin plastered across their faces.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the toughest and most infectious metal riffs colliding with the biggest, phattest hip hop and reggae grooves, cutting edge electronics and a razor-sharp pop sensibility guaranteed to encourage even the most curmudgeonly music fans bellow along with rabid enthusiasm, Skindred are both the ultimate thinking man’s party band. And now, with the release of their fifth studio album Kill The Power, Benji Webbe and his loyal henchmen – bassist Dan Pugsley, guitarist Mikey Demus and drummer Arya Goggin – are poised to spread their gospel of good times and badass tunes to an even bigger global audience.<\/p>\r\n<p>“We know that everyone recognises us as one of the best live bands around,” says Arya. “We’re really proud of all of the albums we’ve made, but we all felt that we needed to make an album that would be as powerful and effective as the live show. That’s what Kill The Power is all about. This time, we want everyone to sit up and listen and join in the party.”<\/p>\r\n<p>“I started DJ-ing a little while ago and it’s taught me a lot,” adds Benji. “Now I feel like I wanted to make an album where every intro to every song makes kids think ‘Fucking hell, they’re playing that song!’ Every middle eight on this album is a banger. Every chorus is massive. On this album, the lyrics are deep and the songs are just bigger than ever.”<\/p>\r\n<p>In keeping with their tradition of making people move while singing about universal issues and spreading a message of positive action and social unity, Kill The Power is an album bulging with fury at the state of the modern world. Never afraid to tackle important topics head on, while never forgetting his band’s mission to entertain and leave the world in a sweaty, sated heap, Benji’s notoriously insane energy levels seem to be creeping up with every album and Kill The Power showcases his most furious and impactful performances to date.<\/p>\r\n<p>“The world’s getting worse so how can I get more mellow?” he laughs. “Of course I’m getting angrier! People normally stay in a bag when it comes to lyrics. Stephen King stays with horror and he’s brilliant at it, you know? With Skindred, it’s always about encouraging an uplift. It’s about a sense of unity. Lyrics can change people’s lives, you know? You can be going down one road and hear a song and have a Road To Damascus experience and become someone else.”<\/p>\r\n<p>On an album that has no shortage of invigorating highlights, Kill The Power takes Skindred to new extremes at both ends of the lyrical spectrum, reaching a new level of fiery intensity on the lethal cautionary tale of “Playin’ With The Devil” and the euphoric end-of-the-working-week celebration of “Saturday”: both songs proving that this band’s ability to touch the heart and fire the blood remains as incisive and potent as ever. As if to enhance their songwriting chops more than ever, Kill The Power also features several songs written in collaboration with legendary songwriting guru Russ Ballard, the man behind such immortal rock staples as Since You’ve Been Gone and God Gave Rock &amp; Roll To You, and this seemingly perverse team-up has led to Skindred’s finest set of lyrics and melodies to date.<\/p>\r\n<p>“Basically, I try to write songs that people can interpret however they like,” says Benji. “When I wrote ‘Playin’ With The Devil’, I originally wrote some words down on a piece of paper thinking about friends I’ve had who smoke crack and live on the pipe, you know? I wrote the song about that kind of thing, but then a couple of days later the riots happened in London and so it became about that as well. When you shit on your own doorstep, your house is going to smell of shit. You’ve got to clean that up! With ‘Saturday’, it’s not a typical Skindred song; it’s a big celebration. We got Russ Ballard involved on that one and he helped me structure the lyrics in the right way so when the chorus hits, it hits like a hammer. It’s an upbeat song but when you listen to the lyrics it goes on about how people all have different reasons to be out and partying. Some people are celebrating, some people are drowning their sorrows, and we all come together on a Saturday. When this record comes out and people go to a club on a Saturday, that’s when it’s gonna go off! The chorus is huge!”<\/p>\r\n<p>While Skindred’s previous album Union Black was dominated by the bleeps, booms and squelches of British electronic dance music, albeit balanced out by Mikey Demus’ trademark riffs, the new album sees the band return to a more organic sound that amounts to the most accurate representation of the Skindred live experience yet committed to tape. From the huge beats and stuttering samples of the opening title track and the laudably demented Ninja through to the insistent melodies and rampaging choruses of “The Kids Are Right Now” and “Saturday” and on to the thunderous, metallic throwdowns of “Proceed With Caution” and “Ruling Force” and the cool acoustic breeze of the closing More Fire, Kill The Power is Skindred cranked up to full throttle and revelling in their own febrile creativity like never before.<\/p>\r\n<p>“It’s all about making an album that moves people in the same way that our live shows do,” says Arya. “We love what we achieved on Union Black and we still used a lot of those basic ideas on Kill The Power, but this time it’s a more organic sound. All the drum loops you hear were originally played by me before we started chopping them up, and there are a lot more guitars on this record too. We love combining all the music that we love in Skindred but we all love heavy music and we’re a rock band at heart and that really comes across this time.”<\/p>\r\n<p>“We’ve delivered an album that’s gonna make people rock for the next few years,” states Benji. “You know what? I can’t do anything about record sales, but if people come to a Skindred show they’re gonna know they’ve been there, you know? Ha ha! The music we make is not about Christians or Muslims, straight people or gay people, black or white or any of that shit. When people are in that room together it’s just Skindred, one unity and one strength!”<\/p>\r\n<p>Having conquered numerous countries around the world, Skindred could easily be taking a breather and resting on their laurels at this point. Instead, this most dedicated and hard-working of modern bands are preparing to launch their most exuberant assault on the world ever when Kill The Power hits the streets. Anyone that has ever seen the band live before will confirm that it is impossible not to get fired up and drawn into the joyous abandon of a Skindred show and with their greatest album to date primed and ready to explode, the best live band on the planet simply cannot fail to conquer the entire world this time round. Wherever and whoever you are, Skindred are coming. Open your ears and get your dancing feet ready…<\/p>\r\n<p>“There’s nothing better than being on stage with these guys,” says Arya. “Skindred is my favourite band and I’m so lucky to be part of this thing we’ve created. We’ve been all over the world but there are always new places to visit and new crowds to play for. We just want to keep getting bigger and better.”<\/p>\r\n<p>“We’re a global band. We’ve played in Colombia and India and everywhere and it’s the same energy,” Benji concludes. “I get letters from people in Hawaii and people in Turkey. It’s all the same. We resonate globally and it’s the greatest thing ever. It seems funny to us sometimes because we’re always kicking each other’s heads in and saying ‘You’re a wanker!’ to each other before we go on stage, but as soon as it’s time to play the show the oneness this band creates together and the unity we bring is unique. I’ve never experienced anything like it and we can’t wait to get back on the road and do it all again.”<br \/>

I meet great people, some of which were a polish hardcore band playing the festival \"There is no tomorrow\" which we stayed in touch with for years after. I would like to share the same experience with my current bandmates, and maybe help bridge the gap between cultures, and show Poland what it is like to be Egyptian coming from afar.<\/p>\r\n<p>we are an independent band all the way from Cairo Egypt, so the travel\/visa expenses are very high. however, this is a part of our challenge that we always find a way to work around, and with the help of festival organizers and supports we manage. if you could support with any financial inputs whether travel cost, accommodation, visa expenses this would help us make the planning easier. 1 Zloty= 4 EGP so anything would help.

The name Fadrait is a Yiddish word with a loose meaning of “distorted from reality\" and “mentally unstable,” which the music tries to embody. Within the early years of writing music as a two piece, the brothers had a plethora of songs and ideas into which direction they wanted to go. Show casing this music to various musicians eventually led to the adoption of&nbsp;&nbsp;two other members, Alan Fox (Bass) and Mikel Mayorga (Guitar\/Vocals). With this new found force of creativity and drive, Fadrait took the local San Diego metal scene by storm and stood proud as one of the few progressive metal bands within it for many years. This led Fadrait to gaining the local recognition and love of the metal scene , but this was cut all too short when in 2018, Fadrait went on a live-performance hiatus due to personal matters affecting the lives of both Mikel and Alan. This eventually prevented them from continuing to be in Fadrait as dedicated members. The search for new members was started a few months after the split, but unfortunately it was also at the same time Covid-19 struck. Through all the setbacks, the brothers continued to play and write music, develop connections, and play in other projects. Post-Covid in August 2022, it was by pure coincidence that Alex was at a friend's gig where he formally met Dylan Kebow (Bass) who was performing in a different band that same night. Dylan and Alex spoke after that show and in the following weeks he was Fadrait’s new Bassist. It was a month and a half before the first Wacken Battle when Ryan Bradley(Guitar), who plays in another band with Dylan, was drafted to fill the other guitar spot. With the addition of these two talented members, Fadrait was reborn and with a new sense of spirit, took aim at the Wacken Battle stage winning first place at each show. With eyes now set on Germany, the renewed Fadrait will represent the United States with their take on progressive metal to Wacken!<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/fadrait\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"fadrait_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/fadrait_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27756}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2471,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fadrait\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2472,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/fadrait\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"","subtitle":"Metal Battle USA","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/8\/f\/csm_fadrait_2023_9fc5db6b1e.jpg","uid":832}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika","uid":220}],"pathSegment":"fadrait","title":"Fadrait","uid":648}],"end":"1690994400","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691024400","start":"1690956000","title":"Wednesday","uid":13},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1536","subtitle":"","title":"W:E:T Stage","uid":8},"start":"1690993200","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"MB USA","uid":902},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"death-in-taiga","pid":176,"title":"Death In Taiga","uid":646},"biography":"<p>Formed in the late 2019, Death in Taiga started as a nameless four-piece act that set out to bring deathcore sounds to the barren musical landscape of Lithuania.

After recording several demos throughout the mid-70’s, this line-up lasted until 1976. Much of the material that would be released decades later as \"First Daze Here\" was recorded by this original incarnation of the band.<br \/> <br \/> Pentagram would then lay dormant until Liebling connected with Joe Hasselvander in 1978. Hasselvander was playing in a singer-less group consisting of himself (drums), Richard Kueht (guitar), Paul Trowbridge (guitar), and Marty Swaney (bass). Liebling soon joined and the group took on the Pentagram moniker as they began performing Liebling's material from the previous Pentagram line-up. After playing several shows and releasing a 7\" single in 1979, personal differences consumed this line-up by the end of that same year.<br \/> <br \/> In 1980, guitarist Victor Griffin and bassist Lee Abney had formed a band called Death Row in Morristown, TN. Griffin then met Hasselvander and relocated Death Row to the northern Virginia area and began playing together. After the trio began rehearsals without a singer, Hasselvander introduced Griffin to Liebling. After only one jam session together, Liebling joined as vocalist for Death Row. Former Pentagram member Martin Swaney soon replaced Lee Abney on bass and the classic Death Row line up was forged. Following demos recorded in 1982 and 1983, Hasselvander left the band, Stuart Rose was chosen as his replacement, and the band changed their name to Pentagram. Subsequently, the 82\/83 Death Row demos, which had been packaged together under the title \"All Your Sins,\" was then released as the first official Pentagram album in 1985... The debut was simply titled \"Pentagram.\"<br \/> <br \/> After recording their second album, \"Day Of Reckoning\" in 1987, the band folded yet again in 1988 when Griffin left for other opportunities on the west coast. In 1989, Greg Mayne (bass) returned and Randy Palmer (guitar) joined Liebling with the addition of Ted Feldman on guitar and Jon Cook on drums. The band was working towards recording a third album, but shortly after their first live performance, they imploded yet again.<br \/> <br \/> In 1993, the \"Death Row\" line-up of Bobby, Victor, Joe, and Marty reformed when Peaceville Records reissued the first two albums. With additional Peaceville support, they went on to release their third full-length album, \"Be Forewarned\" in 1994. Later that same year, Joe and Marty departed once again and in stepped Greg Turley on bass guitar and Gary Isom on drums. This line-up lasted until early ’97 when internal pressures and differences arose and the band went their separate ways.<br \/> <br \/> 1999 saw Pentagram re-emerge once again in name only as a duo consisting of Liebling and Hasselvander. The pair recorded both 1999's \"Review Your Choices\" and 2001's \"Sub-Basement\" on Black Widow Records, but a live version of the band never solidified and, once again, Pentagram's future was in question.<br \/> <br \/> In 2004, Liebling recruited guitarist Kelly Carmichael, bassist Adam Heinzmann, and drummer Mike Smail, all members of Frederick, Maryland based doom act Internal Void. The new lineup recorded the \"Show em How\" album but, as history recounts, this line-up couldn’t survive the ongoing turmoil within Liebling’s life and split soon after the release of the new album.<br \/> <br \/> In August of 2008, a new Pentagram lineup was announced which featured Liebling being joined by Russ Strahan on guitar, Gary Isom, who had played with the band in the mid-90s, returning on drums, and Mark Ammen on bass. After a relatively successful string of shows over the next year and a half, Russ Strahan abruptly left the band in March of 2010.<br \/> <br \/> Just prior to the start of a tour in May of 2010, Pentagram unexpectedly announced the return of guitarist Victor Griffin and bassist Greg Turley as touring members while Griffin's Place of Skulls project was on hiatus. After an overwhelmingly positive reaction by fans and several successful appearances, Griffin and Turley rejoined as permanent members of Pentagram and, in November, signed a three album deal with legendary Los Angeles label Metal Blade Records. With drummer Gary Isom unavailable to attend recording sessions, the band enlisted Place of Skulls drummer Tim Tomaselli and began work on the first Pentagram album in seven years, Last Rites. Shortly after the release of the album, Metal Blade followed up by offering \"When the Screams Come,\" a live DVD documenting the band's 2010 Maryland Deathfest appearance and featuring the Liebling, Griffin, Turley, and Isom line-up.<br \/> <br \/> With the April 2011 release of Last Rites, the band showcased the new album as well as their classic tracks at the South by Southwest festival (SXSW), followed by a European tour which kicked off with a long awaited appearance at the venerable Roadburn festival in the Netherlands. Pentagram continued touring in Europe and the US throughout the remainder of 2011, including the band's first-ever appearances in the UK in its 40 year history.<br \/> <br \/> With Last Rites studio and tour drummer Tomaselli involved in other commitments, coupled with the band's desire to continue touring into 2012, Pentagram began the search for a permanent drummer and brought in longtime Pentagram fan Sean Saley, best known for a stint with legendary DC punk band Government Issue. The band continued to tour in the US, UK, and Europe over the remainder of 2012, playing bigger shows and several major festivals, including Hellfest and Sweden Rock. Around the same time, a documentary film on Bobby Liebling's life and the history of Pentagram, titled \"Last Days Here,\" was released in theaters, on DVD, and eventually through Showtime and Netflix, gaining Pentagram legions of new fans and bringing the band around the world, giving the chance to many longtime fans to see the band in person for the first time.<br \/> <br \/> By late in 2012, and with Place of Skulls idle, Victor Griffin had written and recorded several songs for a new project called In-Graved. He announced he would leave Pentagram at the end of the year in order to finish the In-Graved album and tour behind it. The split was amicable and Griffin and the band agreed that they would likely work together again. Pentagram hired Matt Goldsborough to play guitar in Victor's absence and continued touring throughout 2013. Matt's playing style and tone recalled that of early Pentagram guitarist Vincent McAllister and, as a nod to that era of Pentagram, the band added a few of the 70s-era songs it had not performed live in decades, including the first-ever live performances of the song \"Be Forewarned\" in the band's history.<br \/> <br \/> In January 2014, Pentagram again surprised fans by simultaneously announcing the return of Victor Griffin to the band for a year of touring and writing material for a new album. ​In early 2015, Pete Campbell replaced Sean Saley on drums and Pentagram began work on the its eighth studio release. \"Curious Volume\" is all things Pentagram past and present. The album was released on Aug. 21, 2015 and plans are currently in the works for 2015\/2016 world tours.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/pentagram\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nCouZT0_Fgc","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA

For Metal","uid":585},"biography":"<p>When the mission is so clear, one can - no MUST - express this unmistakably. And so, under the banner of ALL FOR METAL, the metal enthusiasts Tim \"Tetzel\" Schmidt (known as the singer of the band Asenblut as well as a strength athlete and fitness influencer) and Antonio Calanna (singer of the hard rock band DeVicious) join forces. Both are united by their love for classic heavy metal sounds and the common vision to bring them to a new generation of music fans. With great, compact, catchy songs and a dedicated, highly professional production team behind them, ALL FOR METAL unleash anthemic, straightforward metal that has international class.<br \/> \"We grew up with bands like Manowar, at whose concerts the audience is overwhelmed by the energy,\" says singer Tetzel. \"That's where strangers are in each other's arms and fervently belting out the songs. This invisible bond, this connection, is created through the music alone.\" His vocal counterpart Antonio adds, \"I've only experienced such a sense of community in the metal scene. With ALL FOR METAL, we want to help pass this on and let as many music fans as possible share in it.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Right away, the first jointly pre-produced song \"All For Metal\" (introduced in proper style by heavy anvil strikes) with its pounding rhythm, catchy guitar riffs and earworm refrain, is a real hit. Not coincidentally, the lyric line \"It's all for Metal - and Metal for all\" evokes a cohesion here that unites across ages and genders.<\/p>\r\n<p>Euphorized by this early songwriting success, another number was subsequently created with \"Born In Valhalla\", which is no less impressive.

Their grotesque physique grants them a comic element, although the humour tends to be on the grim side as these nocturne beings hunger for human flesh. Unsurprisingly, this has earned them a rather bad reputation. All things considered, FINNTROLL are the perfect embodiment of all aforementioned sentiments – although one might want to replace the hunger for human meat with an unquenchable thirst for booze.<\/p>\r\n<p>With their sixth full-length “Blodsvept”, FINNTROLL return to the fierce harshness of their blackened origins without giving up the perfect balance between darkened metal ferocity and melodic elements inspired by folk music from Finland and far beyond. “We have taken a step backwards”, states main composer Trollhorn. “The production is less polished and weird. To give you a rough idea, “Blodsvept” unites the raving madness of “Niflvind” (2010) with the natural approach of “Nattfödd” (2004).” According to its maker, “Blodsvept” may be described in three words: rawness, power and melody. Add fun to this description and it sums it up just nicely.<\/p>\r\n<p>According to legend FINNTROLL were conceived one drunken night in March 1997. With a heavy dose of beer and vodka mixing a folkish melody in the “Humppa” style of Finnish polka with heavy guitars seemed a great idea to axeman Somnium (ex-Thy Serpent, Impaled Nazarene) and vocalist Katla. When the duo sobered up, the concept still kept its original appeal and thus the mighty FINNTROLL came into being.<\/p>\r\n<p>After much fine or rather rough tuning, FINNTROLL recorded their legendary “Rivfader” demo (1998), which opened the door for a number of musicians to join in order to complete a live line-up. Among these first new members were drummer Beast Dominator (Barathrum, Rapture), Moonsorrow’s keyboarder Trollhorn, Tundra on bass and guitarist Skrymer. A first record deal was signed with the band being able to pick from several interesting offers and a year later their debut album “Midnattens Widunder” (1999) took the world by storm. FINNTROLLs highly original brew rooted in black metal and Humppa proved to be contagious. In the wake of their lead, many musicians were to follow, changing the highly successful formula slightly to fit their own needs. It is no secret that e.g. bands such as Ensiferum, Turisas, Korpiklaani or Wintersun owe their folkish sound to some extend to our dear trolls. Despite their often brutal, heavily anti-religious and coarse lyrics the Finns managed to get away with it probably due to the exclusive and continuing use of the Swedish<br \/> language. With “Jaktens Tid” (2001) FINNTROLL celebrated their international breakthrough. Supported by unanimously praise worldwide, it reached a top 20 chart position in the band’s homeland. Outside of Finland, Century Media licensed this masterpiece to infect the globe with trollish madness. Yet the success came at a steep price as fate struck FINNTROLL hard. First, Katla had to be replaced due to worsening throat problems. After some try-outs the band settled for Tapio Wilska (Sethian, ex- Nattvindens Gråt and many others), who proved to be a great addition as a singer and frontman for European Release Date: March 25th, 2013 the band. Afterwards, the tragic accidental death of Teemu “Somnium” Raimoranta in 2003 threatened to end the band for good. His friends wisely decided to honour Teemu’s<br \/> legacy by continuing his dream. Routa, who had already served as stand-in guitarist at several occasions now became a full time member. This line-up released “Nattfödd” (2004), which took the band to a new level musically as well as on<br \/> festival billings.<\/p>\r\n<p>Due to personal issues FINNTROLL and Wilska decided to part as friends and Mathias “Vreth” Lillmåns joined the fold in 2006. With “Ur Jordens Djup” (2007) and “Nifelvind” (2010) – the latter charted on #8 in Finland and #31 in Germany – the Finns bravely and even more successfully battled on and fortified their position as genre leaders. Meanwhile the band performed headliner shows around the globe nonstop and sold out venues in no time. Musically, their compositions had<br \/> significantly matured and what had begun with Humppa now included many sonic twists and turns. Trollhorn, a truly inspired composer and mastermind behind Moonsorrow, expanded the FINNTROLL sound with cleverness and ease touching up such diverse traditions as Salsa or Klezmer without ever betraying or impairing the band’s roots.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, FINNTROLL embark on a new musical conquest with “Blodsvept”. Under its raw and aggressive surface many surprises await the listener, so better expect the unexpected. Take a seat in the Cotton Club as some New Orleans Dixie grins broadly from “Rösets Kung”. “Skogsdotter” offers duelling banjos taking on a swing band or as Trollhorn states: “We should have used an upright bass on that one”. Anybody wondering what a video-game would sound like with folk music will get an answer from “Ett Folk Förbannat”. “Två Ormar” is unceremoniously slandered as “Beetlejuice on crack” and Trollhorn tenderly calls the “Midvinterdraken” his very own “Flying Spaghetti Monster”. Genius and sheer insanity often go hand in hand and while FINNTROLL never lose the focus for captivating and compact songs, they definitely mastered the art of ‘shock and awe-someness’! So, wanderer beware! If you should ever fall in the hands of FINNTROLL, the undiluted, amazing lunacy of “Blodsvept” awaits you. You have been warned. Now go, get it!<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/finntroll\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ew6syPV1ZOY","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"finntroll_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/finntroll_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27431}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2227,"uri":"https:\/\/www.trollhorde.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2228,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/officialfinntroll"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2229,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/trollballs\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2230,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/finntrollmusic"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2231,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/OfficialFinntroll"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"4ZgkHVHmGPXuRy8zd26ZJX","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/0\/0\/csm_finntroll_2023_d6fccd8892.jpg","uid":763}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Finnland","uid":67}],"pathSegment":"finntroll","title":"Finntroll","uid":592}],"end":"1691003700","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691024400","start":"1690956000","title":"Wednesday","uid":13},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2304","subtitle":"","title":"Wackinger Stage","uid":10},"start":"1691000100","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":925},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"dartagnan","pid":176,"title":"dArtagnan","uid":589},"biography":"<p>Brüder, zur Bühne, zur Freiheit!”<\/p>\r\n<p>Sind die Zeiten hart, eilen die Musketiere zur Rettung herbei. dArtagnan veröffentlichen mit „FEUER &amp; FLAMME“ ihr langersehntes neues Studio-Album, denn kaum etwas spendet so viel Kraft und Trost wie anständige Folk- &amp; Rock-Musik.<\/p>\r\n<p>dArtagnan sind erwachsen geworden. Auf dem vierten Album des Trios erkennt man, dass unter demMantel der Musketieremehr steckt,als die eskapistische Sehnsucht nach scheinbar besseren vergangenen Zeiten. Die Band klingt geerdet und die Texte zeigen eine bislang kaum gekannte persönliche Seite der Nürnberger. So erzählt Frontmann Ben Metzner in der ergreifenden Ballade „Solang‘ Dein Blut“ die Geschichte vom viel zu frühen Tod seiner Mutter. Es war die Musik und die Folk- und Mittelalterszene, die dem Teenager nach seinem schweren Verlust in jungen Jahren den Halt gegeben hat, weiterzumachen und Hoffnung zu schöpfen.<\/p>\r\n<p>Durchhalten und Mut machen ziehen sich passend zur aktuellen Weltlage wie ein Roter Faden durch FEUER &amp; FLAMME. Die deutschen Folkrocker liefern weiter die geliebten historischen Musikgemälde vom Kaliber „Völkerschlacht“, aber die Band erdet sich immer wieder selbst in Momenten wie „Mein Leben lang“, in dem Gitarrist Tim Bernard persönlich zum Mikrofon greift, da er liebevoll seiner kleinen Tochter gewidmet ist.<br \/> dArtagnans viertes Album klingt ein gutes Stück dynamischer und rockiger als seine Vorgänger. Die Live-Erfahrung zahlreicher Touren und Konzerte hat die Band reifen lassen. Es erscheint nur konsequent, dass die Band mit Felix Heldt erstmals einen ausgewiesen Live-Experten zum Produzenten von FEUER &amp; FLAMME auserkoren hat und außerdem selbst als Co-Produzent zur Tat geschritten ist.„Felix kennt unsere Bühnenenergie wie kein anderer“, lässt Bandkopf, Sänger und Multiinstrumentalist Ben Metzner wissen. „Gerade in diesen schwierigen Zeiten konnten wir mit ihm die idealen Vorrausetzungen schaffen für die Aufnahmen dieses Albums.“ Und das hört man dem Album an. Der Titelsong „Feuer &amp; Flamme“ rockt so unbekümmert wie es einst nur die Toten Hosen vermochten. Und auch die Eröffnungsnummer „C‘est la vie“ trifft den Sound der Band „irgendwo zwischen Irishpub und Stadionrock“ wie Metzner erläutert.<\/p>\r\n<p>In solchen echten LIVE Hits spiegelt sich der Erfahrungsschatz von bereits drei Alben und turbulenten ersten Jahren wieder, den das erfolgsverwöhnte Trio seit seiner Gründung im Jahr 2015 und dem sofortigen Senkrechtstart mit SEIT AN SEIT (2016) angehäuft hat. Schon das Debütalbum heimste Gold ein und auch der Nachfolger VEREHRT UND VERDAMMT (2017) erstürmte die Top 10 der Charts. Auf ihrem dritten Album IN JENER NACHT (2019) erweiterten die Gründungsmitglieder Ben Metzner sowie Gitarrist und Sänger Tim Bernard nochmals ihre Klangpalette, indem sie sich Teufelsgeiger Gustavo „Gustl“ Strauß als neuen Mitstreiter an ihre Seite holten.<\/p>\r\n<p>Natürlich liefern dArtagnan auf FEUER &amp; FLAMME erneut jede Menge Spaß an der Freud, für den sich Künstler hierzulande fast schon entschuldigen müssen. Doch die Nürnberger können auch anders. Der frische Gassenhauer „Auf uns‘re Frauen“ verbeugt sich bei allem Augenzwinkern tief vor dem eigentlich starken Geschlecht und mit dem schwungvollen Deutschrocker „Scharlatan“ bezieht das Trio Stellung, indem es Brandredner und Populisten lachend entwaffnet.

BÜTCHER’s unique blend of metal music is certainly rooted in both German and US Speed Metal, but owes equally as much to proto-metal, hardrock, South-American and Australian black\/thrash, NWOBHM both obscure and world dominating, and the Scandinavian cult from the early 90’s. To put it simply: BÜTCHER operates in a spectrum influenced by the twin lead masters from the UK – yet derives as much from the legacy of Sweden, Switzerland, Canada and Brazil. These maniacs thrive on the combination of the musical and artistical significances we have come to adore, and deliver a furious frenzy of speed, black &amp; heavy metal – all brewed in a cauldron of analog &amp; vintage recording material. An acquired taste in these modern times then, but surely to be savoured by the legion of metal maniacs that have an affection for everything that made the older eras of heavy music so magical in the first place.<\/p>\r\n<p>The band originated in the early 2000’s, had several line-up changes, suffered a long hiatus… and none of it seems to matter: it brought the armoured core of the band together. Since 2014, through toil and thunder, shredmaster KK Ripper and vocal performer R Hellshrieker have moulded BÜTCHER into a machine of vicious and unrelenting Metal Power. Currently joined by the immense qualities of LV Speedhämmer and AH Wrathchylde the band has really formed its own identity, and the BÜTCHER name is spreading like wildfire throughout the metal underground worldwide – ready to burst out!<\/p>\r\n<p>BÜTCHER is fully embracing its vision, its members willing to push through. To bring unadulterated metal pleasures to anyone that feels to crash, bang &amp; wallop. The metal community is both united and fragmented – let others be the judge of what’s what. But during their intense live performances the bands knows, sees and feels the confirmation of their specific style in the reaction of the crowd. Their musical integrity stems from the conviction of crafting their wide array of influences into a premise of their own. Add to that their dedication to bring the most energetic live show one can give, and it is sparking a fire in the audience. A fire that more often than not engulfs in a consuming blaze of metal mania.<\/p>\r\n<p>Consider the lack of edits, digital sound compression or most modern recording techniques on their debut BESTIAL FÜKKIN’ WARMACHINE (Babylon Doom Cult Records, 2017) and the sophomore album 666 GOATS CARRY MY CHARIOT (to be released by Osmose Productions in 2019). Take a look at their stage wear, taking cues from the classic acts yet adorning it with a blood oath of their own. But above all, absorb the full-on metal assault that has been edged into black wax, burned into silvered discs as well as coded into streamable format.<\/p>\r\n<p>Then you will realize: this is Metal.

EVILDEAD’s debut live appearance was on April 11, 1987 at Fender’s Ballroom in Long Beach, California on a bill that also featured CRYPTIC SLAUGHTER, DARK ANGEL, and POSSESSED. Soon after the band entered the recording studio to record their classic 3-song demo; featuring the songs “The Awakening”, &nbsp;“Sloe-Death”, and “Process: Elimination”. The EVILDEAD sound was unique; highlighting a blend of speed and thrash metal guitar riffs along with hyper drumming locked in with an over the top thundering bass with punk overtones, and lyrical themes that explored political, thought provoking social ideas; mixed with horror, and nuclear war themes.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 1988, EVILDEAD signed a worldwide recording contract with SPV Records and released the “RISE ABOVE” Ep featuring two original tracks; along with a cover version of the BLACK FLAG anthem “Rise Above” this debut generated a strong underground buzz with lots of airplay, and media support which led to a strong fan base. In the summer of 1988, EVILDEAD entered Music Grinder recording studios with Producer\/Engineer Cacey McMakin (NUCLEAR ASSAULT, KREATOR) to record the classic full-length album ANNIHILATION OF CIVILIZATION.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 1989 the band had some line-up changes along the way before their first successful European tour with co-headliners LAAZ ROCKIT. In 1990 EVILDEAD returned to the recording studio with producer Warren Croyle to track their second studio album entitled THE UNDERWORLD released in 1991 to rave reviews. It attributed a more refined metal sound; featuring a cover version of the SCORPIONS “He’s a Woman\/She’s A man” with guest appearance by vocalist and metal legend DAVID WAYNE (METAL CHURCH). After releasing their follow up release “LIVE…FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE UNDERWORLD” the band disbanded in 1992 with members pursuing other projects.<br \/> In 2009 after constant inquiries and demands to reform for a reunion\/live appearance; EVILDEAD returned in October. The line-up featured original drummer ROB ALANIZ, along with original guitarist JUAN GARCIA, original bassist MEL SANCHEZ, and lead guitarist ALBERT GONZALES with STEVE NELSON handling the vocal duties in place of original vocalist PHIL FLORES. The band toured Europe in 2011 co-headlining shows with SADISTIC INTENT. This included live-appearances at “Way of Darkness” Festival in Germany, and also “Jalometalli” festival in Finland with additional dates throughout Europe. EVILDEAD went on hiatus a short time thereafter, but returned once again this time with original vocalist PHIL FLORES, and bassist KARLOS MEDINA from “The Underworld” line-up taking over bass duties. The past few years has consisted of performing select live shows to appease a new generation of fans. EVILDEAD have been hard at work with Producer Bill Metoyer on their long awaited comeback full-length studio album.<br \/> In 2019 EVILDEAD secured a recording deal with SPV\/Steamhammer records for their upcoming release entitled “UNITED $TATE$ OF ANARCHY”. It will feature nine studio tracks plus a metalized cover version of the B-52’s “Planet Claire” as a bonus track. Seminal artist Edward J. Repka has once again illustrated the cover of the new album, to be released on CD\/digipack and colored vinyl. The band has compiled a collection of new songs that are a throwback to their roots of thrash. With “United $tate$ of Anarchy”, EVILDEAD has returned more powerful than ever and awakened again to annihilate the masses.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> EVILDEAD is:<br \/> Albert Gonzales – Rhythm\/Lead Guitars<br \/> Juan Garcia – Rhythm\/Lead Guitars<br \/> Rob Alaniz – Drums<br \/> Phil Flores – Lead Vocals<br \/> Karlos Medina - Bass<\/p>\r\n<p>Discography<br \/> EVILDEAD – Demo (1987)<br \/> EVILDEAD – RISE ABOVE &nbsp;Ep (1988)<br \/> EVILDEAD – ANNIHILATION OF CIVILIZATION (1989)<br \/> EVILDEAD – THE UNDERWORLD &nbsp;(1991)<br \/> EVILDEAD - “LIVE….

Ich zähle mich ohne rot zu werden zu den Menschen, die den Orgelgott abfeiern. \"King Of Heimorgel\" ist nunmehr das sechste Studioalbum des einzigartigen Alleinunterhalters und es gibt wie immer einzig und allein den Sound seiner Electone D85 Heimorgel und seinen unvergleichlichen Gesang zu hören. Der Gesang ist nach objektiven Standpunkten natürlich wieder unglaublich beschissen, aber gerade das macht eine Mambo Kurt Platte doch aus. Dieses teils unglaublich neben der Spur liegende, aber doch nie uninspiriert wirkende Genöle... herrlich. Nicht unerwähnt bleiben darf natürlich der Gastgesang von Orgellehrerin Heidi Schulz, die mal wieder noch schlechter singt, als der Chef selbst (man höre sich \"Rhythm Is A Dancer\" an!!!). Am Konzept hat sich, Gott sei Dank nichts geändert. Mambo interpretiert Hits aus Rock, Pop und Metal auf seine ihm unnachahmliche Art und Weise auf...? natürlich der Heimorgel. Ob Motörheads \"Ace Of Spades\", Lady Gagas \"Pokerface\" oder System Of A Downs \"Chop Suey\", hier ist nichts sicher; heilig aber schon, denn man merkt den Stücken allesamt an, dass stets mit dem nötigen Respekt an sie heran gegangen wurde. Vanilla Ice' \"Ice Ice Baby\" klingt in der Orgelversion sogar wesentlich cooler als im Original. Mehr Titel möchte ich aber bewusst nicht verraten, ist das Schmunzeln doch noch größer, wenn die Songs überraschend kommen. \"King Of Heimorgel\" ist auf jeden Fall erneut ein Pflichtkauf für alle Fans schräger Coverversionen. Fans des Meisters müssen sowieso zuschlagen. (Rezension: David Lang)<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"bodytext\">Was erwartet den geneigten Zuschauer live? Ein Alleinunterhalter mit einer Heimorgel spielt Coverversionen von Songs, die man nie an einer Heimorgel erwartet hätte. Hardrock- und Popklassiker erhalten einen ganz eigenen Stil und es groovt gewaltig. Die Heimorgel fährt mit ihren herrlichen Plastiksounds sofort in das Tanzbein und macht Mambo-Kurt-Fans von den ersten Takten an glücklich. Dazu kommen manchmal sinnentleerte, manchmal aber auch hochgeistige Zwischeneinlagen des Meisters, es fiept, es rockt. Weltspitzenklasse. Mambo ist der einzige, bei dem nach „Slayer“ „Dr. Alban“ kommen darf, und nach „Abba“ „Rage against the Machine“, ohne dass irgendjemand an der Richtigkeit zweifeln würde. Ein Mambo-Kurt-Konzert ist erst dann gelungen, wenn es ein Stagediving und eine Polonaise gab, und bis jetzt hat es immer geklappt.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"bodytext\">Mambo Kurt war 1982 westdeutscher Meister im Heimorgelspielen in der Altersgruppe der bis 14jährigen. Ende der 90er bot er zum ersten Mal im kleinen Kreis Coversongs auf der Heimorgel dar. Sofort fand sich in Heavy-Metal Kreisen eine große Fangemeinde, da Mambo eine Vorliebe für Rocksongs hat. Legendär ist seine „Enter Sandman“ Version als Walzer. Der Trash-Hype der Jahrtausendwende spülte Mambo ins TV, zu RTL und VIVA2, um genau zu sein. Es folgte ein Engagement am Schauspielhaus Hannover in 2003 und eine Komponistentätigkeit für ARTE. Im Jahre 2006 war Mambo als Fanbotschafter für die ARD bei der FIFA WM unterwegs. Als Vorsitzender der deutsch-holländischen Fussballfreundschaft, brachte er das Kunststück fertig, jeweils eine WM-Single in Deutschland und Holland zu veröffentlichen. 2005 war Mambo der Moderator von „Rock-Guerilla“ bei „ROCKHARD“. Seit 2006 ist Mambo Kurt einmal die Woche als kleinste Studioband der Welt in der SWR latenight Show im TV zu sehen. 2011 bespasste er „STERN-TV“ auf RTL und Sondersendungen zu Grandprix und Frauen-WM im ZDF.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"bodytext\">Der Terminator unter den Alleinunterhaltern is back, Mambo trennt die Massen schneller als Moses das Meer, liebt ihn oder hasst ihn. Er ist der „King of Heimorgel“.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/mambo-kurt\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jeYRLtX5tEQ","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"mambo_kurt_2020.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2020\/mambo_kurt_2020.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27897}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2515,"uri":"https:\/\/mambokurt.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2516,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mambokurtoffiziell\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2517,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mamboookurt\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2518,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/Orgelgott"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"29t2xhTM0SRjm8iTNVMynh","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/0\/0\/csm_mambo_kurt_2020_28e263a0e0.jpg","uid":847}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"mambo-kurt","title":"Mambo Kurt","uid":203}],"end":"1690983000","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691024400","start":"1690956000","title":"Wednesday","uid":13},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2688","subtitle":"","title":"Welcome To The Jungle","uid":13},"start":"1690979400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":887},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"wacken-das-perfekte-parallelunicersum","pid":176,"title":"Wacken - Das perfekte Paralleluniversum","uid":669},"biography":"\r\n<p><strong>Wacken – das perfekte Paralleluniversum.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Was die Gesellschaft von Metalheads lernen kann.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Ein Buch über die Liebenswürdigkeit der Metalheads und den sozialen Aspekt der Metalszene. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Von Dr. Lydia Polwin-Plass und Dr. Michael Gläser<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Infos zum Buch:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>„<em>Das Herz ist bei den Metalheads am rechten Fleck. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><em>Alles was sie tun, ist mit viel Liebe, Seele und Herz verbunden“<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Doro Pesch<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wie ticken Metalheads wirklich?

The desire to<br \/> achieve the rock star dreams like so many before her, Jan took her group to Hollywood but<br \/> soon retooled the line-up, which included; vocalist Janet Gardner, drummer Roxy Petrucci<br \/> and bassist Share Ross (Pedersen).<br \/> In 1987 a pair of big brass balls at EMI Records decided to roll the dice with Vixen, despite all<br \/> the stereotypes regarding bands fronted by chicks was then initiated into the male<br \/> dominated club of hard rock. EMI released their self-named debut album \"Vixen\" featuring<br \/> the groups’ first hit \"Edge of a Broken Heart\" penned by Richard Marx and Fee Waybill (The<br \/> Tubes). MTV became Vixen’s playground and so coupled with exhaustive touring Vixen<br \/> embarked on their ride.<br \/> Piling on more hits the band charted Billboard at #22 with ballad, \"Cryin'“ and \"Love Made<br \/> Me\" at #36. The road continued to call opening for Ozzy Osbourne, Scorpions, Eddie Money<br \/> and many others. Vixens had firmly distinguished themselves as a premiere rock act to be<br \/> taken seriously.<br \/> With the pistons still popping, Vixen released their second album; \"Rev It Up\" was a success<br \/> with \"How Much Love\" as the prized single performed live on The Arsenio Hall Show. The<br \/> group Vixen-ize their fans on worldwide tours with heavyweights KISS and Scorpions, which<br \/> fueled the International frenzy. The ballad, \"Love Is A Killer\" rose on the charts along with the<br \/> rocker \"Not A Minute Too Soon\" once again establishing Vixen as not just performers but hit<br \/> songwriters.<br \/> It was Nirvana’s sound out of Seattle that helped fuel the winds of change and underscored<br \/> the decision to disband Vixen in 1992. Separately band members dabbled in various side<br \/> projects but it was 1997 when Gardner and Petrucci released “Tangerine\" teaming up with<br \/> live-wire guitarist Gina Stile under the Vixen moniker. In 2002 Kuehnemund once again<br \/> regrouped Vixen fronted by Jenna Sanz-Agero (vocals), Lynn Louise Lowry (bass) and Kat Kraft(drums). This line-up then went on to tour and release “Live and Learn” and “Extended<br \/> Versions” from a live performance in Sweden.<br \/> The bond they shared could never be broken but who would have imagined their joy would<br \/> be short-lived when in 2012 Kuehnemund reached out to Gardner, Pertrucci &amp; Ross for long<br \/> awaited reunion. Sadly, only days before officially announcing the news, Kuehnemund was<br \/> diagnosed with cancer and the reunion was put on hold. Jan Kuehnemund, the founding<br \/> member and lead guitar player for Vixen passed away October 10th of 2013.<br \/> Veni, Vidi, Vici<br \/> (I came, I saw, I conquered) by Julius Caesar<br \/> Realizing that a band belongs to its fans, Gardner, Petrucci and Ross have carried on the<br \/> Vixen legacy since 2013. Rocking theaters, casinos and major festivals including M3, The<br \/> Moondance Jam, Monsters of Rock Cruise, FireFest, Hard Rock Hell, The Halfway Jam,<br \/> Rockin’ the Rivers, Iowa State Fair, every nook and cranny of the USA, Canada and Spain,<br \/> Vixen is revvin’ the engines once again.<br \/> In 2017, guitarist Britt Lightning (Alejandro Sanz, Rachel Platten) signed on to round out<br \/> this extraordinary line up. Vixen consistently delivers high energy top notch performances<br \/> that leave fans breathless and wanting more at every show.<br \/> In 2019 a new chapter begins with the addition of Lorraine Lewis (Femme Fatale) stepping<br \/> into lead vocals and Janet Gardner pursuing other ventures. Lewis rounds out the finely<br \/> tuned lineup bringing notable Femme Fatale MTV video hits “Waiting for the Big One” and<br \/> “In and Out of Love” to Vixen's catalogue of crowd pleasers.<br \/> As we roll into 2022, and much reflecting, Share Ross decided to take a sabbatical to focus<br \/> on a prospering real estate career… In steps Brazilian rocker Julia Lage. Julia spent over a<br \/> decade with Latin Grammy nominated Barra Da Saia, playing arenas all over South America,<br \/> plus perfoming live with members of The Cars, Extreme, and Sugar Ray.

It is for this reason Heep were coined the Beach Boys of Heavy Metal,&nbsp;and their influence is there for all to see in other bands including ‘Queen.’ They were also one of the forerunners of using the Hammond organ along with Micks signature wah wah guitar and this became the template for their sound.<\/p>\r\n<p>Success has followed the forging of such an audacious formula. Across 25 studio albums, along with myriad live releases and compilations, Uriah Heep have managed to sell 40 million records worldwide, four million of those in the US. Impressive American numbers, but that leaves 36 million records to be sold in the rest of the world, underscoring the fact that Uriah Heep have become, through their relentless dedication to touring, a truly global band, with particular success in Germany, Scandinavia, Japan, Eastern Europe and Russia, where they were the first Western rock band to play live in Moscow in December 1987 to 180,000 people.<\/p>\r\n<p>Through their success as Rock n’ Roll pioneers this enabled other bands to follow in their wake and Russia is now part of every bands touring schedule.<\/p>\r\n<p>What is perhaps even more admirable than the love for the band across the globe has been the quality and consistency of the band’s music across a myriad of personnel changes, some of them potentially critical, beginning with the loss of charismatic vocalist David Byron after the band’s ninth studio album, <em>High and Mighty<\/em>, issued in June 1976.<\/p>\r\n<p>Indeed, some of these personnel shuffles might have been responsible for a fallow period in the late ‘70s, the accepted nadir in the narrative being 1980’s <em>Conquest<\/em> record. But in 1982, the band stormed back (as they would again in 1995) with a classic of British heavy metal called <em>Abominog<\/em>, which entered the top 40 in the USA. This album featured Peter Goalby on vocals. and in the annals of Uriah Heep history, this record, a conquering document released smack in the thick of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, is revered by Heep fans on par with such classics as 1971’s <em>Look at Yourself<\/em> and 1972’s <em>Demons and Wizards<\/em>, even if the band’s music had been overhauled and supercharged for a new decade. Similarly stadium-rocking records <em>Head First<\/em>, issued in 1983, and <em>Equator<\/em>, issued two years later, capped off this exciting era for the band.<\/p>\r\n<p>As a way of contextualizing the band’s extensive history, the well regarded FM-friendly Peter Goalby years might be considered the third era of Heep’s extensive and productive history. As recap, one might frame the first era of the band as encompassing the classic David Byron years along with the productive co writing stewardship of Ken Hensley, culminating in 1973’s double <em>Live<\/em> album, sent to #37 on the US charts with the help of timeless Heep classics like “Sunrise,” “Sweet Lorraine,” “Circle of Hands, “epic masterwerk “July Morning” and smash hits “Easy Livin’” and “Love Machine,” both examples of the bands mastery of the heavy metal shuffle.<\/p>\r\n<p>Following this, the second era of the band might be said to encompass the years 1974 to 1981. Although containing a few David Byron-fronted albums, this time period features underrated records like <em>Firefly<\/em> and <em>Fallen Angel<\/em>, along with 1977’s <em>Innocent Victim<\/em>, which sold over a million copies in Germany alone. Each of these featured ex-Lucifer Friend singer John Lawton on vocals, and each helped build and maintain the band’s legacy of intensely professional harmonies across songs rife with joyous and even spiritual melody.<\/p>\r\n<p>Yet despite Uriah Heep’s esteemed place in rock history being assured through the likes of <em>Demons and Wizards<\/em> and <em>The Magician’s Birthday<\/em> alone, the most inspiring chapter of the Uriah Heep saga must surely be that of the band’s fourth era, marked by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keyboardist Phil Lanzon joining in 1986 followed by vocalist Bernie Shaw in 1987, both Phil and Bernie are still in the band to this day and the first recording with them both was a live album entitled ‘Live in Moscow,’ documenting being the first western rock band to be invited to play in Russia. This was followed by a studio album called <em>Raging Silence<\/em> which was the start of the Box\/Lanzon writing partnership.<\/p>\r\n<p>Indeed, given the massive commercial status of Uriah Heep in the ‘70s, along with considerable attention afforded the guys in the early ‘80s, it’s become a bit of an urban myth that this is a band plagued by lineup changes. The fact of the matter is, for over 30 years, from 1986 to 2007, Uriah Heep had consisted of patriarch Mick Box on lead guitars, Bernie Shaw on vocals, long-time member Lee Kerslake on drums, Trevor Bolder on bass and Phil Lanzon keyboards.<\/p>\r\n<p>It is only with the retirement of Lee Kerslake through bad health and the death of Trevor Bolder that the band found it necessary to add new blood. Russell Gilbrook auditioned to become Heep’s drummer and he bought along the right measure of energy that they were looking for which gave the band a lift, and on that day he made the drum position his, adding a strong dynamic to the Heep sound. After the death of Trevor Bolder, Dave Rimmer came along and when he auditioned we quickly found that he was the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle and we had our all important rhythm section. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>And it hasn’t been that this 30-plus year “fourth phase” for the band has been any sort of victory lap. Admired and respected as fans have been for the consistency and high quality of the long-standing Uriah Heep lineup over these last three decades in the live environment, the band has also consistently put out excellent new music faithful to storied Heep trademarks such as heaviness, use of Hammond, the challenge of the shuffle, and the always essential use of wah-wah when Mick is inclined to tear off one of his life-affirming guitar solos.<\/p>\r\n<p>Indeed, if through the 1990s, Uriah Heep had worked at a relaxed pace they’ve issued three albums of completely new music—<em>Wake the Sleeper<\/em>, <em>Into the Wild<\/em> and <em>Outsider<\/em>—with a fourth scheduled to be recorded in October of 2017. The run, however, really begins with the highly regarded <em>Sea of Light<\/em> from 1995, a fan favourite that finds the songwriting team of Box and Lanzon yielding huge creative returns. Up into 2014’s <em>Outsider<\/em>, on which the two co-write every song, the band were rewarded with a late-period hit in “One Minute,” a huge crowd-pleaser at all live shows across the globe.<\/p>\r\n<p>And through all this rich history, in the wings—or as parallel story lines as it were—Uriah Heep have conducted a thriving “Official Bootleg Series” and they celebrated their 40th anniversary with a re-recordings album called <em>Celebration<\/em>, followed by a tour of 250 shows all over the world (60 different countries, in fact).<\/p>\r\n<p>They’ve had ex-members die (most notably Gary Thain, David Byron, Trevor Bolder and recently Jon Wetton), although on a lighter note, they’ve had ex-members—Lee Kerslake and Bob Daisley—that at one time were fully half of the classic Ozzy Osbourne Blizzard of Oz band! Even earlier than that they had &nbsp;Kiss, ZZ Top, Foreigner and Rush as support bands which gave those bands their first break.<\/p>\r\n<p>The point of all this is that even now, nearly 50 years after the band’s inception, the sun seems to be shining down upon Mick Box and Uriah Heep,&nbsp;and Uriah Heep are one of only a small clutch of heritage acts that are doing everything a band must do to be considered vital, namely touring worldwide and regularly recording and releasing vital, high quality, exquisitely produced full-length records that continue to capture their fan base’s imagination. If there’s another band born in 1969 that has stayed as engaged with their fans as Heep, all the power to them. But for Mick Box, music has never been a competition—him an’ Heep will keep spreading their many messages of positivity all over the world and gaining new fans along the way. Their songs and music have stood the test of time and with even more new songs on the horizon the mighty ‘Heep’ are as strong and powerful as ever.&nbsp;<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/uriah-heep\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PHgDPxLlFW4","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":false,"title":"WOA 2019","uid":1},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"uriah_heep_2019.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2019\/uriah_heep_2019.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":23125}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":434,"uri":"http:\/\/www.uriah-heep.com\/newa\/index.php"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":435,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/uriahheepofficial\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"45O9BwPMyywM755SYUK0sP","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/4\/4\/csm_uriah_heep_2019_07039ff69d.jpg","uid":125},{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"uriah-heep","pid":176,"title":"Uriah Heep","uid":124},"biography":"<p>Among venerable UK rock institutions, with Black Sabbath and Jethro Tull dispersing, we are, perhaps, really, down to just Deep Purple, Yes and Uriah Heep left to uphold the tradition of quality original progressive hard rock forged at the very beginning of a golden era for this music, late ‘60s into the nexus year that was 1970.<\/p>\r\n<p>At that crossroads, along with Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, Uriah Heep helped invent a decorative and uniquely British form of heavy metal with their debut album, Very ‘Eavy, Very ‘Umble.

Russell Gilbrook auditioned to become Heep’s drummer, bringing along an insane level of energy that propels each reconsidered Heep classic from the bottom up, while driving the new songs with a vitality rare among venerable heritage acts.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the death of Trevor Bolder, Dave Rimmer came along and when he auditioned, the guys quickly found that he was the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle.

Even earlier than that they had Kiss, ZZ Top, Foreigner and Rush as support bands, cherished memories which gave those bands their first break, all of them speaking fondly of their time with Mick and the boys.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In January of 2018, the band entered Chapel Studios in England with producer Jay Ruston (Stone Sour, Anthrax, Steel Panther) and recorded their latest offering, Living the Dream. The album was released worldwide in late 2018 on Frontiers Records. An extensive world tour was immediately underway to support the release and the band are still on the road with the record, indicative of the pride the guys feel with this release. “Working with Jay was amazing,” reflects Mick. “He totally understood what we were going for and delivered big time. We wanted a Heep album that the band and the fans would be proud of, and with Jay at the helm, we have delivered that.” Bernie calls Living the Dream, “a full-blown, ‘rockin’ Uriah Heep record. All the traits that made Heep famous in the past are here. Passion, power, harmony and substance… these are Heep trademarks you’ll get from the first riff.”<\/p>\r\n<p>The point of all this is that even now, 50 years after the band’s inception, the sun seems to be shining down upon Mick Box and Uriah Heep. Fact is, Heep are one of only a small clutch of heritage acts that are doing everything a band must do to be considered vital, namely touring worldwide and regularly recording and releasing high quality, exquisitely produced full-length records that continue to capture their fan base’s imagination.

They’ve stuck to their guns, weathered the trends and outlasted their peers – never once wavering from the ferocious noise that excited them as teens. If anything, that thirst for sonic warfare is just as strong, if not stronger, today. Where others have suffered from creative malnourishment and artistic uncertainty, something which even metal’s biggest and best are prone to, <strong>Kreator<\/strong> have always charged full steam ahead – thanks to the red-eyed conviction and fearless determination of founding singer and guitarist Miland ‘Mille’ Petrozza. On 1985 debut <strong>Endless Pain<\/strong>, the Essen innovators created the template for extreme noise to come, fusing elements of thrash and black metal in ways that had never been heard before. Their sophomore album of the following year, <strong>Pleasure To Kill<\/strong>, became one of the landmark albums of 1986 – making metal history alongside key releases from Metallica, Slayer and Megadeth. And onwards they marched, bringing hellish anthems to the masses in every album that followed, with a track record few could ever rival.<\/p>\r\n<p>The last decade has been a particularly exciting time for the group, with 2012’s <strong>Phantom Antichrist<\/strong> proving how they could embrace modern production techniques and move with the times without forsaking the underground spirit and defiance which made them a household name in the first place. Its successor, 2017’s <strong>Gods Of Violence<\/strong>, saw them topping the German charts for the very first time in their career, a feat virtually unheard for a band of such thunderous intensity. Returning this year with fifteenth opus <strong>Hate Über Alles<\/strong> – which marks their first studio album with Frédéric Leclercq (ex-Dragonforce, Sinsaenum) on bass, joining Mille, guitarist Sami Yli-Sirniö and drummer Jürgen ‘Ventor’ Reil – the metal titans are once again channelling an unholy heaviness strong enough to tilt the earth off-axis...<\/p>\r\n<p>“We still like to challenge ourselves, I guess that’s what it comes down to,” says Mille, when quizzed on the secret to their longevity and flawless credentials. “Every time we make an album, it feels like the first one. We take our time, it’s important to have something to say rather than releasing things just for the sake of putting out something new. Quality <em>always<\/em> over quantity. Why put out meaningless, boring albums? I’d rather build on the essence of what I’m trying to say and what I want people to feel. That’s why we sound so angry and edgy.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Angry and edgy are certainly words that epitomise what’s at the very core of <strong>Kreator<\/strong>’s musical DNA. But even with the legacy behind them, they’re not ones to rest on their laurels and bask in the light of past glories – even when concocting the follow-up to a chart-topping creative and commercial peak…<\/p>\r\n<p>“We didn’t feel any pressure in regards to the success of the previous album,” continues Mille. “Of course we’d like to top the success and intensity, but it’s not really something we think or talk about. It’s more of an internal competition. My gut feeling when writing music is: if <em>I<\/em> like it, the fans will too. That’s the only measurement. So it’s not really pressure, more of a nice healthy competition with ourselves. If something doesn’t feel heavy or passionate enough, it won’t be good enough for us or our fans.”<\/p>\r\n<p>As for the name <strong>Hate Über Alles<\/strong>, which translates as Hate Above All, it’s a phrase which came to Mille after a closer look at the world around him. With political and personal ideologies exacerbated by the age of the Internet, he notes how we are all now forced to exist in a society edging further and further into the extreme. “<strong>Hate Über Alles<\/strong> reflects the time we’re living in,” says Mille. “<em>Everything<\/em> is really loud and aggressive. The way we communicate has changed, thanks to social media. It causes a lot of imbalance. The world is in a state of disrepair. Life is not harmonic right now, it’s disharmonic… that’s where I was going with the title.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Bassist Frédéric Leclercq makes his studio debut with the band on <strong>Hate Über Alles<\/strong>, following his first appearance on stage as a member of <strong>Kreator<\/strong> at the Santiago Gets Louder Festival in October 2019. For Mille, it was wonderful to see the French virtuoso bringing an abundance of energy and passion into the sessions at Hansa Studios – the Berlin facility where David Bowie famously recorded Low and Heroes – with producer Arthur Rizk (Power Trip, Cavalera Conspiracy) lending his expertise behind the desk.<\/p>\r\n<p>“Frédéric brought a lot to the table, especially in terms of arrangements,” reflects Mille. “We even co-wrote a song together called <strong>Dying Planet<\/strong>, which is the last song on the album and one of my favourite tracks. I think there is so much more to come from him and me collaborating – just you wait and see! He’s a fresh breath of air… someone who is very talented and musical.”<\/p>\r\n<p>As for other highlights on their new masterpiece, Mille cites <strong>Midnight Sun<\/strong>, <strong>Strongest Of The Strong<\/strong> and <strong>Conquer And Destroy<\/strong> as personal favourites – the former of which showing how this band, despite their rich heritage and well-honed sonic profile, aren’t afraid of trying new things. “<strong>Midnight Sun<\/strong> has a female voice, which we’ve never used in <strong>Kreator<\/strong> before,” he adds. “We collaborated with a singer called Sofia Portanet who lives in Berlin. The rhythm is really unique and there’s also a great story in the lyrics. We’re not looking to reinvent ourselves but we like to find a new focus within the same sound, coming at our music from a slightly different angle.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Unlike pretty much every other release scheduled for 2022, this is no lockdown album. The majority of its 11 tracks were written and demoed before the pandemic – and though the last 18 months have been a frustrating time for musicians around the world (“you start feeling useless because you miss the fans,” explains Mille), Kreator have embraced the inevitable and found inspiration where many have struggled.<\/p>\r\n<p>“Most of this album was ready by the end of 2020 and we were supposed to tour in 2021, but then we moved everything back,” he summarises. “I’m glad we did because that allowed more fine-tuning. I can actually see the positive aspects of these crazy times – it’s allowed us to explore themes even deeper and come up with something <em>monumental<\/em>. That was the focus point for this album, treating our music almost as therapy. We’ve missed playing. We took all of that emotion and put it into the final versions of these songs – and you can hear it. Hope, anger and power… it’s all there.”<\/p>\r\n<p>It most certainly is. Conquering and destroying in the way only <strong>Kreator<\/strong> can, <strong>Hate Über Alles <\/strong>will undoubtedly sit proudly as the finest metal of its year. And so onwards they march once more…<\/p>\r\n<p>----<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Kreator<\/strong> is:<\/p>\r\n<p>Miland ‘Mille’ Petrozza – vocals\/guitars<\/p>\r\n<p>Sami Yli-Sirniö – guitars<\/p>\r\n<p>Jürgen ‘Ventor’ Reil – drums<\/p>\r\n<p>Frédéric Leclercq – bass<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/kreator\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P6GrO1Xng4w","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"kreator_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/kreator_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27391}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2184,"uri":"https:\/\/www.kreator-terrorzone.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2185,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/KreatorOfficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2186,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kreatorofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2187,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kreator"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2188,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCRUh-7YyUCBTw2FjhS_jJAw"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"3BM0EaYmkKWuPmmHFUTQHv","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/7\/d\/csm_kreator_2023_1f6b1420c5.jpg","uid":751}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"kreator","title":"Kreator","uid":581}],"end":"1691091900","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"768","subtitle":"","title":"Harder","uid":5},"start":"1691086500","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":940},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"terror","pid":176,"title":"Terror","uid":637},"biography":"","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/terror\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N-xClO7R57g","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"terror_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/terror_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27552}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2418,"uri":"https:\/\/www.sticktight.la\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2419,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/terrorhardcore\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2420,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/terrorhardcore\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2421,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/terrorhardcore"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2422,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCtQwayvZe6oVoaXErRu2iQQ"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"1GVRgPtEC6sZFqvItIk3eg","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/5\/4\/csm_terror_2023_84912cd7b8.jpg","uid":817}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika","uid":220}],"pathSegment":"terror","title":"Terror","uid":637}],"end":"1691059500","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691056800","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":941},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"cemican","pid":176,"title":"Cemican","uid":281},"biography":"<p>In 2008 starts CEMICAN forging, forming a musical Project where the main idea is to merge and fully integrate prehispanic instruments to metal gender to achieve the essene of mysticism, cult and ideology of the ancient cultures of mexico in the music created by CEMICAN.<\/p>\r\n<p>Starts as Tlipoca project ( drums, prehispanic instruments ) and Tecuhtli ( vocals, guitar prehispanic instruments ) creating compositions which would be, his first album under the name of \"OMETILIZTLI “ recorded entirely by Tlipoca and Tecuhtli.

Over the course of 11 full-lengths, two of which, 1999’s grand vision Projector and 2007’s furious fan-favorite Fiction, were nominated for Swedish Grammy Awards and countless worldwide tours, the Swedes have persevered through thick and thin. This endurance is powered by Dark Tranquillity’s insatiable hunger to constantly and consistently reinvent, to confront stagnation, even when all signs point to staying put and relying on a successful formula. From the day lauded debut, Skydancer, hit store shelves in summer 1993 to the shock and awe of Projector’s unorthodoxy to 2002’s stupendous Damage Done to the urban noir of 2013’s killer Construct effort, the Swedes, now men, whose perspective is now of wisdom and contemplation, continue to unflinchingly challenge the unknown. That new album, Atoma, marks the group’s silver anniversary couldn’t be more perfect.<\/p>\r\n<p>“When we first started putting together the band in late 1989 I was 15,” remembers vocalist Mikael Stanne. “The band has been the main focus in my life before I was an adult. So, naturally this is more than just second nature. It’s a huge part of who we are and as much as you sometimes try go get away from categorizing yourself of putting yourself in a certain spot it is still definitely there. I am absolutely fine with growing old as a band and as a person. So many cool things have happened because of the band, but also so many other things totally unrelated and in a way these things inform each other and bleed over. I wouldn’t change a thing.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Neither would guitarist Niklas Sundin, who along with Stanne and drummer Anders Jivarp, round out Dark Tranquillity’s original core. Together, they’ve seen and done it all. From the poetic lyrics of The Gallery and The Mind’s I to the genre-breaking sonic explorations of Haven and its more aggressive relative in Character, the group’s ventures were of vision and courage. To Dark Tranquillity, limitation, to creatively fester, wasn’t an option. They were always willing—with eyes and ears on continuity—to move forward, even in times uncertain and impetuous. Atoma, an album three years in the making, is proof there’s still more depth in Dark Tranquillity.<\/p>\r\n<p>“I think it goes beyond fear,” Stanne gasps. “You go through all kinds of emotions going into something like this. Where do we go? Do we still have something to offer and say? Can we maintain the high quality we’ve set for ourselves? All these things play into our insecurities, but as you slowly move towards the finish line that very thing turns into great triumph and relief. It’s so easy to second guess yourself and go back and forth between ideas until you eventually lose sight of what you were supposed to do. But that just means more time is needed to work something out and as hard as that is sometimes the end result is what matters. As long as you get there, it will all be worth it.”<\/p>\r\n<p>BRAVE NEW WORLD<br \/> The writing for Atoma was gradual. The Swedes didn’t want to rush into their 11th full-length without their usual democratic prudence. That doesn’t mean they weren’t enterprising, however. Drummer Jivarp and long-time keyboardist\/tactician Martin Brändström had up to 20 songs on offer, before the rest of the band shaved it down to 12 key tracks. The songs were then re-shaped and re-tooled. As with Construct, there was more freedom, a precedent set by the band not, say, the record label, to try new things, to expand upon ideas that seemed insignificant at the time, but ultimately blossomed into fully formed songs. “Encircled”, “Force of Hand”, “The Pitiless”, and the contemplatively dark “Merciless Fate” are successful products of Dark Tranquillity’s ‘new’ process. “In a way, every new album feels liberating,” Sundin levels. “But there might be a certain sense of ‘openness’ on Atoma that we hinted on with Construct. In my view, we managed to stay relevant by creating something that’s unmistakenly Dark Tranquillity, while still adding somewhat of a new perspective. This is particularly the case with the arrangements, that are a bit more musically advanced (as opposed to complex) than before.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Whereas We Are the Void and Construct were dark, city-like, and, at times, cold, Atoma’s center is one of diversity and energy. For certain, there are odes to the monolithic abyss in tracks like “Faithless by Default” and bonus track “The Absolute”, but overall the album represents a more colorful Dark Tranquillity. Across Atoma’s hour-long span, there’s more in common with tracks like “Hours Passed in Exile” and “The New Build” and “The Wonders at Your Feet” than, say, “Uniformity” or “Dream Oblivion” or “Iridium”. For long-time fans, Atoma is best represented by a single word: urgency. There’s criticality to what Dark Tranquillity are up to. As expected, there’s heft—physical and emotional—behind the music.<\/p>\r\n<p>“We’ve always wanted to make honest and serious music,” reminds Sundin. “It’s always flattering to see just how heavily our songs can resonate with some people. Again, it’s very subjective. I’ve seen fans in the front row crying from songs that, to me, convey entirely different moods, and there are people stage-diving and moshing to the more mellow songs as well. I don’t want to dictate how anyone should respond to the new songs. I’m sure that those who formed a strong emotional attachment to our previous albums will do the same with Atoma.”<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> TERRIBLE CERTAINTY<br \/> Indeed, Dark Tranquillity’s music has carried seriously honest qualities throughout the years. Album after album, fans have connected deeply with the Swedes. While much of that is in the heartfelt guitar harmonies by Sundin or the ominous moods Brändström beams, there’s also lyrical weight, with emphasis on presentation by Stanne. The two—music and lyrics—are inseparable, really. With Atoma, Stanne and team decided world events were too vital to ignore. Fortunately, as most mellow with age, Dark Tranquillity are likely traveling in the opposite direction.<br \/> “Where Construct dealt with betrayal, trust issues and disappointment, this one is full of anger, doubt and fear,” Stanne asserts. “There is so much going on in the world right now and without touching on politics, I tried to find an angle that speaks to our human nature in these rather extreme circumstances. How do you empathize with people whom we know nothing about, how do we communicate the horrors of the world to our children, and how far do we stretch our imagination in order to make sense of it all? So, I am fascinated by our personal defense mechanisms and the ways through which we manage to get our point across no matter its validity. In observing this through a skeptic and atheist filter, I manage to find plenty to be upset about.”<\/p>\r\n<p>For all the vibrancy and new hues Dark Tranquillity imbued in Atoma, there is also loss. Actual loss, in fact. Earlier this year—after faithfully serving as bassist, guitarist, and songwriter for two and half decades—founding member Martin Henriksson realized he had enough. Luckily, the parties ended the relationship amicably, with Henriksson moving from band member to back office, where the business side of things is handled. With Henriksson out, the second guitar slot is currently vacant. Separately, Dark Tranquillity transitioned age-old friend Anders Iwers, also bassist for Tiamat and reactivated cult death metal act Ceremonial Oath, from session work to permanently join the fold. “It feels strange of course, after nearly three decades of playing together,” Sundin contemplates. “Compared to most other bands that have been around for so long, we’ve had an extremely stable lineup, so the departure of an original member is not to be taken lightly. However, Martin did the right thing since the motivation just hadn’t been there for a quite some time.”<\/p>\r\n<p>CONSTRUCTION TIME AGAIN<br \/> As with Dark Tranquillity albums starting with Character, much of Atoma was recorded at Brändström’s studio, Rogue Music. There, the group settled into the normal process of cutting an album, something they’ve done with varying degrees of pain and suffering since 1993. But what separates the new album from previous efforts is the lack of big, sticker-on-album-sleeve names. We Are the Void was mixed by Tue Madsen at Antfarm Studios, while Construct was mixed and mastered at Fascination Street Studios by Jens Bogren. Though Dark Tranquillity did enlist Studio Gröndahl’s David Castillo (Katatonia, Soilwork) to mix the record, Atoma, by contrast, was mostly done close to the vest.<\/p>\r\n<p>“There is certainly comfort in recording in Martin’s studio,” reveals Stanne. “It’s close and it’s great in every way. But everything about recording is something of a chore. The writing is great, full of anxiety and sleepless nights, but great. Then, the actual recording is just an end to that process and in a way the creativity ends there and I have mixed feelings about that. And as much as you feel that anything can happen during the writing, the actual recording is very mechanical and sterile. It’s just a matter of getting the most out of your instrument, making the most out of the song and making sure that you don’t screw up. I think the reason we worked so hard and long making this album was the feeling that we really needed to prove to ourselves that we can pull it off. And as I look back on it now the struggle and anguish are all there on the album. It’s stronger because of it.” With a new album, a new lineup, and a refreshed outlook, Dark Tranquillity are stronger now than they were six months ago; they’re a better band than they were 10 years ago; and the Swedes are far more resilient now than they were as wide-eyed teenagers. No question, it’s been a saga and a journey. But Atoma is the start of a new chapter. It represents new life. With tracks like “Forward Momentum”, “Force of Hand”, “Our Proof of Life”, and the riveting title cut, there’s no stopping Dark Tranquillity in 2016. Or, in the years to follow. “There are so many aspects of this album that I feel so strongly about that if just one tiny part of that translates to the listener I’d be satisfied,” Stanne says. “As much of a struggle the creation of an album can be, now that we hear the final product I feel invincible. And ready for 11 more albums!”<br \/> &nbsp;<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/dark-tranquility\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2ug2G16deYQ","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"dark_tranquility_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/dark_tranquility_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27429}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2219,"uri":"https:\/\/www.darktranquillity.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2220,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dtofficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2221,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/darktranquillityofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2222,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCtXQxTPk1Nz4hc7yqy1QVbA"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"5EHvXKnNz78jkAVgTQLQ5O","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/d\/0\/csm_dark_tranquility_2023_fbe6cbef21.jpg","uid":761}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Schweden","uid":186}],"pathSegment":"dark-tranquility","title":"Dark Tranquility","uid":590}],"end":"1691073000","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691069400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":943},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"imminence","pid":176,"title":"Imminence","uid":541},"biography":"<p>Heaven in Hiding is yours to find.

Metal band that mixed the character of Western Movies and their sound: Those melodies by Ennio Morricone and Scott Joplin that are impregnated in the memory of anyone who has seen Clint Eastwood perform as a young man. with the heavy imprint of bands like Metallica, Black Label Society and Death, among others.<\/p>\r\n<p>The premise was simple: Create songs that would respect both influences, but at the same time be original, and that could be played in any circumstance. The name of the band? An iconic word, used at times as a vainglorious adjective, and at others as a derogatory adjective, but one that fits perfectly with what it represents: FORASTERO (Foreigner)<\/p>\r\n<p>After several presentations in various venues, saloons and rodeos, the name of the band began to grow and the songs began to consolidate. At each show, every time Gerardo was heard singing a shrill “Fuckin beer”, each of those present was heard to respond with “Oh yeah”.<\/p>\r\n<p>But fortune decides to be elusive, and destroys the band, when suddenly its members start to disappear. The group becomes unstable, with two members, it doesn't work. Rumors that the band does not exist begin to be heard in the bars. That peace is coming. The headlines of the newspapers Pray “End of the dry law?” and in the lower corner of that same page, very small, it reads: \"End of band of outlaws?\" It is at that moment, drunk and at the bottom of a saloon, César and Gerardo are approached by a stranger with a glass eye. The aristocrat P.C. Movies. He tells them that in the evening of the next day they should go to the town's cistern, there they will meet a young man who will return them to the path of crime. Not knowing if this was a vision due to their drunken state, or a real meeting, both go to the place, where a young man with few words and programmed attitudes, almost as if he were a machine, begins to walk next to them and returns them. to the tracks This young man is neither more nor less than Bruno Abreu (drums).<\/p>\r\n<p>The band begins to gain strength again. They shoot a video clip, and in the middle of filming, they realize that a guitar is not enough to capture with enough forcefulness the message they want to give. It is then that, in a nearby church, seeking God's help, they meet Father Yerse Piriz (guitarist), who curiously wears several strange watches and few crucifixes to belong to the clergy.<\/p>\r\n<p>Yerse joins the band, thus forming the final lineup. They currently have several shows, they are in the process of recording their first LP, and rumor has it that if you see a rolling bush pass by on the main street of your town, breaking the silence, it means that a stagecoach is coming behind it. metal, which reads: FORASTERO WESTERN METAL.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/forastero-western-metal\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v0VYirLPtJg","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"forastero_western_metal_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/forastero_western_metal_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27757}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2473,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/forastero.uy\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2474,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@forasterowesternmetal"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"6YkwXebyubEij3bNOsxO3k","subtitle":"Metal Battle Uruguay","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/c\/7\/csm_forastero_western_metal_2023_cdb61c22d2.jpg","uid":833}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Uruguay","uid":221}],"pathSegment":"forastero-western-metal","title":"Forastero Western Metal","uid":649}],"end":"1691058900","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1408","subtitle":"","title":"Headbangers Stage","uid":7},"start":"1691057700","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"MB Uruguay","uid":960},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"ghetto-ghouls","pid":176,"title":"Ghetto Ghouls","uid":650},"biography":"<p class=\"p1\">Ghetto Ghouls is a bunch of pukes from the underground of crossover thrash, punk and hardcore… as well as horror, action and exploitation.

It is what it is, whatever it is.<\/p>\r\n<p>September 2016 Whoredom Rife debuted with the self-titled EP released by Terratur Possessions, along with a debut concert at Prague Death Fest.<\/p>\r\n<p>2017 marks the first full-length album, titled Dommedagskvad, also released by Terratur Possessions, and would see the full band surface to the stage both in Oslo and Bergen on their respective festivals, namely Inferno and Beyond the Gates. Dommedagskvad was&nbsp;nominated for the Norwegian grammys in the category: \"Best metal album of 2017\".<\/p>\r\n<p>In 2018 \"Nid - Hymner av Hat\" was released after touring the U.S. and playing several festivals in Europe., including Brutal Assault, Tons of Rock and Throne Fest, to name a few.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>2019 Whoredom Rife supported Behemoth on a two week tour in the Baltics playing in front of massive crowds to high acclaims.<\/p>\r\n<p>2020 marks the release of \"Pakt\" a 10\" split with fellow countrymen Taake, as well as a 7\" called \"Ride the Final Tide\". An official video was made for for the latter. This year also marks the team up with District 19 as their official booking partner.<\/p>\r\n<p>2021 A new full-lenght is in the mixing process and an extencive tour with Archgoat is planned for Autumn<\/p>\r\n\r\n","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/whoredom-rife\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hD8qSJQDXxQ","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"whoredom_rife_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/whoredom_rife_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27226}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2026,"uri":"https:\/\/whoredomrife.bandcamp.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2027,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Dommedagsryttere"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2028,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/whoredomrife\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"5BPuwHD7jA85XePrEFUIIk","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/8\/a\/csm_whoredom_rife_2023_b515f683f6.jpg","uid":714}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Norwegen","uid":158}],"pathSegment":"whoredom-rife","title":"Whoredom Rife","uid":555}],"end":"1691078400","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1408","subtitle":"","title":"Headbangers Stage","uid":7},"start":"1691075700","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":965},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"immolation","pid":176,"title":"Immolation","uid":553},"biography":"<p>Just as one can smell a storm swelling on the horizon, the cataclysmic tremor that is<br \/> IMMOLATION approaches to unleash its latest, immense creation: ACTS OF GOD. Due to be<br \/> released in winter of 2022, this 11th studio album serves as the next chapter of<br \/> IMMOLATION’S Death Metal epic. With 5 long years passed since the most recent studio<br \/> album, ATONEMENT, ACTS OF GOD vigorously showcases IMMOLATION’s ability to<br \/> consistently create fascinating sounds, while still keeping their feet firmly rooted in the old<br \/> school, New York Death Metal for which they are renowned.<\/p>\r\n<p>Emblazoned with a haunting new masterpiece by artist Eliran Kantor, ACTS OF GOD displays<br \/> a trifecta of angelic beings desperately trying to prevent one another’s flesh from melting in a<br \/> blackened light from above. The muted colors and ethereal images will ring familiar to fans of<br \/> IMMOLATION’s previous album covers. “We wanted this cover to feel much darker; more<br \/> melancholy and hopeless. The music has always been very dark, and a lot of Kantor’s work<br \/> had the feeling that we were going for; the semi-surreal colliding with a classic, almost<br \/> renaissance feel,” explains founder and vocalist\/bassist Ross Dolan. “It’s unnerving. It really<br \/> reflects the music perfectly,” agrees founder and guitarist Robert Vigna.<br \/> The album’s third track “The Age Of No Light” is a powerful, hard hitting song with an extreme<br \/> yet catchy melody. “It’s quick, hits hard, and gets straight to the point” explains Vigna.<br \/> Consistently changing speeds and patterns throughout, the song is short but remains both<br \/> dynamic and memorable.<\/p>\r\n<p>“Blooded” has all the usual IMMOLATION elements: the slow, the fast, the explosive, the big<br \/> overlaid sections of groovy harmony eventually dropping into evil, ripping guitar work. “It’s a<br \/> little powerhouse,” describes Vigna, “it’s straightforward, and it has all the elements you would<br \/> expect from us in a nice, neat package.”<br \/> A song like “Immoral Stain” is a slightly mid-paced track with an intense, creepy atmosphere.<br \/> Equipped with plenty of unusual moments, the beat is catchy, dark, and echoing. Searing guitar<br \/> starts to recite a story and then quickly begins a conversation with thunderous vocals and a<br \/> vociferous beat. “That whole section of build up just needed to be done exactly as it is. That’s<br \/> what makes it sound different and interesting,” describes Vigna. Much like the rest of the<br \/> album, while the lyrics cover the usual, general topics of genuine evil and the great deception<br \/> of religion, the specifics are most certainly left to the listener’s interpretation. Fortunately for<br \/> IMMOLATION fans, there is no shortage of corruption and catastrophe in this world.<br \/> Fittingly, the concluding track “Apostle” was the last song written for the album. “Some of those<br \/> chorus sections have a weird almost dream-like quality,” describes Dolan. Its steadily growing<br \/> momentum discharges rounds of guitar solos and relentless vocals which eventually lead way<br \/> to an explosive finale to the album.<\/p>\r\n<p>The creative journey for ACTS OF GOD began with years of notes, and an abundance of<br \/> inspiration. With Vigna at the helm of the structural writing as usual, further composing and<br \/> concepts were tossed back and forth amongst all 4 members. Eventually, they began to<br \/> skeletonize the beginning of what would become a full length, studio album. While the<br \/> recording process and entering the studio can be a very sterile experience for some musicians,<br \/> the ferocity of the demos combined with the expertise of long time friend and recording<br \/> counterpart Paul Orofino of Millbrook Studios (BLUE OYSTER CULT, BAD CO, GOLDEN<br \/> EARRING), assured that this would not be an issue for IMMOLATION. “Having such a level of<br \/> comfort is key,” remarks Dolan. Final touches were brought about on the mixing and mastering<br \/> by Zack Ohren of Castle Ultimate Studios.<\/p>\r\n<p>Firmly aligned with Nuclear Blast Records, the often coveted sound of IMMOLATION has<br \/> reemerged from the depths of a cursed and cruel world to illuminate our minds and ears with<br \/> exquisite, sonic destruction.<br \/> &nbsp;<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/immolation\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6lP6Z7PSOFM","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"immolation_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/immolation_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27224}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2018,"uri":"https:\/\/immolation-store.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2019,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/immolation"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2020,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/immolation_band\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2021,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/Immolation"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2022,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/immolation"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"3rt16vhD1OuULlsyxUUWIt","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/4\/3\/csm_immolation_2023_bbe8be21b4.jpg","uid":712}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika","uid":220}],"pathSegment":"immolation","title":"Immolation","uid":553}],"end":"1691086500","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1408","subtitle":"","title":"Headbangers Stage","uid":7},"start":"1691082900","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":966},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"carpathian-forest","pid":176,"title":"Carpathian Forest","uid":550},"biography":"","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/carpathian-forest\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cohYDC-26rU","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"carpathian_forest_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/carpathian_forest_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27221}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2010,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/carpathianforest\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"0sFntmE9T1tiF6G6O6Lm3H","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/d\/8\/csm_carpathian_forest_2023_f97218c794.jpg","uid":709}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Norwegen","uid":158}],"pathSegment":"carpathian-forest","title":"Carpathian Forest","uid":550}],"end":"1691095500","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1408","subtitle":"","title":"Headbangers Stage","uid":7},"start":"1691091900","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":967},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"blacksheep","pid":176,"title":"BlackSheep","uid":644},"biography":"<p>The band Blacksheep started as studio project in 2012 , building&nbsp; on Foundation raised by the death'n'roll legend such as Entombed and Carcass.<\/p>\r\n<p>Two years later, the future started with \"The future started yesterday \" a full-length album that paved the path of the band for what is it now.<\/p>\r\n<p>It was followed by \" Gunsmoke \" (single, 2016), \"Weather Report\"(EP, 2017), \"La fel \" (with Aliosha H8, single, 2017), \" Rivers of words \" (with Aliosha H8, single, 2018), \"War ethics\" (EP, 2018), \"Star Traveler \" (single, 2019), \" Gordian Knot\" (single, 2020), \"World's most beautiful suicide\" (EP, 2021) and a presence on the compilation \"Fertile soil Compilation vol.1\" -

Having run out of inspiration and wanting to try other things they called it a day the same year they released their fifth album Reclaim The Beat, and ever since fans have hollered for their reunion. In 2021 they got what they were asking for when the band’s core lineup - guitarist Lars Löfven, drummer Matte Modin and bassist\/vocalist Gustaf Jorde - got back together. “We just wanted to record a couple of songs to include in a vinyl box set,” explains Jorde. “The songs turned out good and the process was satisfying so we decided to have a go on a full-length.” The result is the corrosive Grind Over Matter, 11 blistering songs packed into 34 minutes, not only proving that the band still have what it takes but that they are playing at the absolute top of their game.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the vinyl box set not happening, the two songs the band initially recorded were released as the Fleshless And Wild single. Says Jorde, “At that time we had made up our minds on a continuation, so that release was kind of a gift to everyone who has encouraged us to get back together through all these years.” None of the members took any convincing to reform or to push ahead with the full-length, starting to seriously write in Autumn 2021, and there was no masterplan guiding them. “We just wanted to see what we sounded like today, with new perspectives on things. We knew it had to be fast and furious yet diverse.” The result is an album “filled to its maximum with power and energy”, this made clear by opener “Bent Out Of Shape”, which is perhaps the greatest start to any of their records. They do not take it easy on the listener from there on, with the likes of the thrashy “Dear Devil” and groove-laden “Unburdened By Genius” taking very different tactics in the damage they wreak, the band making a point of not repeating themselves while staying true to that classic Defleshed sound.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The title an obvious play on the term ‘Mind Over Matter’, Jorde is coming from a different place lyrically than fans are used to. “This time around traditional murder, war, and gore lyrics didn’t come to me. So I wrote from a viewing perspective, beholding the world and man’s influence on the same.” This manifests itself in a variety of ways, “Bent Out Of Shape” standing as “an illustration of how everything is standardized and mainstreamed to enable mass production and economic growth, leaving nothing left to be organic, wild and &nbsp;vivid”, while “One Grave To Fit Them All” is “A tale of a man who hates and kills everyone who differs from himself, resulting in sitting alone on the throne with no one left to hate.” Then there is “Dear Devil”, which is about “A wish - and demand - list written as a letter to The Underworld by a narcissist who arrogantly enough believes such a letter will be respected,” Jorde always writing insightfully, giving the listener something to think about.<\/p>\r\n<p>The album was tracked at Rorysound Studios, Uppsala, Sweden, with Lawrence Mackrory, with two weeks devoted to drums, another two for guitar and bass and two three-day sessions for vocals. “It was pretty straightforward, the hardest part was to not get carried away by impulsive ideas too much, but stay put to the original plan,” says Jorde. Additional vocals on “Heavy Haul” and closer “Last Nail In The Coffin” come courtesy of the band F.K.Ü, who are also Uppsala natives, adding an extra dimension to the songs, the rest of the album strictly the work of the three band members.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>There are plans to play shows in support of the record, though whether this will mean actual touring is not yet established. Asking Jorde if the fires still burn as hot after a 17-year break, he answers plainly. “Definitely hotter than 17 years ago, as we then disbanded for the opposite reason. But everyone has their lives and obligations so the band can only be a part-time thing - and the good thing with that is that on those occasions everyone is inspired.” And given the inspiration on display with Grind Over Matter it is a very good time to be a Defleshed fan, old or new. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>DEFLESHED line-up:<br \/> Gustaf Jorde – vocals\/bass<br \/> Lars Löfven – guitars<br \/> Matte Modin – drums<\/p>\r\n<p>DEFLESHED discography (albums only):<br \/> Abrah Kadavrah (full-length, 1996)<br \/> Under The Blade (full-length, 1997)<br \/> Fast Forward (full-length, 1999)<br \/> Royal Straight Flesh (full-length, 2002)<br \/> Reclaim The Beat (full-length, 2005)<br \/> Grind Over Matter (full-length, 2022)<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/defleshed\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jsmD7K1Ma7o&list=PLy8LfIp6j3aIufQplgxB8JkWygzGHALly","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"defleshed_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/defleshed_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27223}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2015,"uri":"https:\/\/www.metalblade.com\/Defleshed"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2016,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/defleshedofficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2017,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/defleshed_official\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"213LVImPkyKRbtskA6q7P8","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/f\/9\/csm_defleshed_2023_4940e03845.jpg","uid":711}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Schweden","uid":186}],"pathSegment":"defleshed","title":"Defleshed","uid":552}],"end":"1691091000","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1536","subtitle":"","title":"W:E:T Stage","uid":8},"start":"1691087400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":957},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"abbath","pid":176,"title":"Abbath","uid":549},"biography":"","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/abbath\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y8FeCvC5bgk","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"abbath_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/abbath_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27220}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2007,"uri":"https:\/\/www.abbath.net\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2008,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/abbathband\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2009,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/abbath_official"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"1epGwdbjU7JSGVBHlqptpx","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/3\/f\/csm_abbath_2023_26b1f64b5f.jpg","uid":708}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Norwegen","uid":158}],"pathSegment":"abbath","title":"Abbath","uid":549}],"end":"1691100000","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1536","subtitle":"","title":"W:E:T Stage","uid":8},"start":"1691096400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":958},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"mutz-and-the-blackeyed-banditz","pid":176,"title":"Mutz and the Blackeyed Banditz","uid":596},"biography":"<p>A charismatic rock-band with traditional roots and a pithy catchy tune.<br \/> The classical 5piece combo from Northern Germany score with authenticity and joy of playing, live and on record.<br \/> Within a short time, the Lower Saxony boys can count in WDR Rockpalast, Wacken, Werner Rennen a.s.o. in their references.

Even if youʼve never even been to Scotland, even if youʼre not a seafaring<br \/> type, you know them. Thatʼs because the twelve anthems—and make no mistake, these are<br \/> anthems—The Real McKenzies have picked for this new album have been sung by others for<br \/> decades, if not centuries. A dual celebration of Scottishness and the band, which is celebrating<br \/> its 30th anniversary this year, Songs Of The Highland, Songs Of The Sea drops on Fat Wreck<br \/> Chords on November 18th and is comprised entirely of famous traditional sea shanties that are<br \/> roughly divided, as the recordʼs title suggest, between land and sea. And even though the idea<br \/> for the album was initially proposed by guitarist Mario Nieva, these songs speak to frontman<br \/> Paul McKenzieʼs heritage as well as who he is, and who he always has been. Some might have<br \/> been written long before he was born, but these are still his stories, wound inextricably into his<br \/> life experiences.<br \/> “Mario thought we should attempt to do this,” he explains. “It wouldnʼt take a lot of time in<br \/> terms of writing, because all the songs were already written. In fact, most of the songs are<br \/> ancient. Theyʼre really old. I myself, being completely nautical, unfortunately due to the<br \/> pandemic, had to sell my ship, because I just simply couldnʼt afford it, much like Angus Walters,<br \/> who sold The Bluenose. That ship is on the Canadian 10 cent piece, so every Canadian can have<br \/> reference to that piece of history, although a lot of Canadians now donʼt give a shit now, or<br \/> donʼt know.”<br \/> To some extent, these songs are their own references to that history, brought up to date by the<br \/> Vancouver, BC-based band and given a Celtic punk makeover. How else could it start, then, than<br \/> with the “Scotland The Brave”? But here, its recognizable bagpipe melody soon gives way to—and<br \/> then joined in unison by—electric guitars in a perfect confluence of past and present. Thatʼs the<br \/> pattern throughout this record. Old songs are imbued with new relevance for these modern<br \/> times, and delivered with the kind of intensity and passion that only someone in tune with the<br \/> history of the music and the country could deliver so emphatically. As the only constant and<br \/> remaining member in the bandʼs history, he does so with a relatively new collection of merry<br \/> music makers, but it sounds like theyʼve been playing together for years and years.<br \/> “You can really hear the camaraderie on these songs,” says McKenzie. “There was never any<br \/> contention when we were making it, but if there was a question, weʼd sit down just like the<br \/> sailors did and talk about it. Because the last thing you need when youʼre in a van—or a sailing<br \/> ship—is contention. Because the next step is keelhauling...”<\/p>\r\n<p>If youʼre unaware, keelhauling is an old-fashioned method of extreme torture and execution,<br \/> where a sailor would be thrown overboard on one side of the ship and then dragged its keel.<br \/> McKenzie is joking, of course, but having suffered something of a mutiny just before the<br \/> pandemic, when his entire band at the time decided to call it quits, it certainly explains just how<br \/> heʼs able to infuse these ancient marinersʼ rhymes with such emotion and depth of feeling.<br \/> Thatʼs especially impressive considering a number of these songsʼ lyrics—“My Heartʼs In The<br \/> Highlands”, “Ye Jacobites By Name” and “A Red, Red Rose”—were written by the 18th century<br \/> Scottish poet Robert Burns. That might seem like an odd thing for a punk band to do, but anyone<br \/> who knows The Real McKenzies will be aware itʼs not the first time theyʼve sung his words.<br \/> Indeed, the singer has a real soft spot for the literary legend.<br \/> “Nobody else in the world is doing Robert Burns in that format,” he says. “I was raised with<br \/> Robert Burns and I just love him. I think weʼve covered 15 of his songs. One of the things about<br \/> Canada that you have to understand is that in the ʼ20s, Robert Burns was fucking huge, and<br \/> Scottish music was also huge there back then. Even today, thereʼs a Robert Burns statue in every<br \/> major city in Canada.”<br \/> This album is only partially Robert Burns, though. It also includes wonderfully life-affirming (yet<br \/> somehow still melancholy) versions of two of the best known sea shanties, “Drunken Sailor” and<br \/> “Dead Manʼs Chest”, though the latter was a actually fictional one created by Robert Louis<br \/> Stevenson for his iconic 1883 novel Treasure Island). Thereʼs also a gorgeously resigned<br \/> rendition of “Sloop John B”, the Bahamian sea shanty popularized by The Beach Boys back in<br \/> 1966. “They made a Californian pretty boy version of it,” says McKenzie, “but itʼs not supposed<br \/> to be that way. Itʼs supposed to be a fucking hard ass sailor singing it.”<br \/> And then thereʼs the version here of the early 20th century folk song, “Swansea Town”, a song<br \/> that means so much to McKenzie he couldnʼt even bring himself to sing it. Instead, he got The<br \/> Last Gang vocalist Brenna Red to fill in. Like all of these songs, itʼs one that helped shape him,<br \/> and which still sits at the very core of who he is all these years later.<br \/> “At that point in time,” he explains, “I just couldnʼt do it. I was at an emotional stress point at<br \/> that time in my life. I am a sailor, and Iʼve been sailing since 1963, when I had my first sailing<br \/> adventure with my grandfather. He was way more of an asshole fucking c*nt than I am. He was<br \/> renowned for this. My parents used to say ʻIf you misbehave youʼll have to go spend the summer<br \/> with your grandfather!ʼ They used it as a point of contention and as a threat for me. But<br \/> unbeknownst to them, my grandfather and I got along great. He taught me everything I know<br \/> about boats and sailing. Itʼs because of him that Iʼve been a sailor my whole life, so when Mario<br \/> suggested we do this I had to say yes. I have a feeling for all these songs. They mean so much to<br \/> me.”<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/the-real-mckenzies\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0MYWQBQgKvM","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"the_real_mckenzies_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/the_real_mckenzies_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27269}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2067,"uri":"http:\/\/realmckenzies.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2068,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/therealmckenzies\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2069,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/therealmckenzies\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2070,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/OfficialRealMcKenzie"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"1YczG6BNjM9XAnw64RqnXi","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/d\/a\/csm_the_real_mckenzies_2023_53ba8e6843.jpg","uid":723}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Großbritannien","uid":74}],"pathSegment":"the-real-mckenzies","title":"The Real McKenzies","uid":562}],"end":"1691071200","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2304","subtitle":"","title":"Wackinger Stage","uid":10},"start":"1691067600","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":970},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"unzucht","pid":176,"title":"Unzucht","uid":643},"biography":"<p>In über zehn Jahren Bandgeschichte sind Unzucht zu einer der bekanntesten und beliebtesten Dark Rock Bands des Landes gereift.

The band formed in the summer of 2016 after Anna Murphy (vocals, hurdy-gurdy, multi instrumentalist), Merlin Sutter (drums) and Ivo Henzi (guitars and bass) left Swiss folk metallers ELUVEITIE, which they had all played in for over a decade. But they weren’t ready to end their musical journey together yet, and embarked on a new and different path. “With Cellar Darling, we deliberately didn’t set ourselves any limits – and that really enabled us to find the type of music that we wanted to play,\" the band explain.<\/p>\r\n<p>What quickly developed was a unique and fresh combination of grand and heavy riffs, powerful drumming, and a unique voice, along with the signature earthy tones of the hurdy-gurdy, confidently fusing progressive metal &amp; rock with elaborate lyrical tales. In September 2016, following a summer of intense songwriting sessions, Cellar Darling self-released their first single \"Challenge\" along with the bonus track \"Fire, Wind &amp; Earth\", to overwhelmingly positive reactions from around the world. Signing to Nuclear Blast Records in January 2017 was swiftly followed by 3 single releases (\"Black Moon\", \"Avalanche\", \"The Hermit\"), all met with a staggering support from an ever growing fanbase. Cellar Darling's debut album \"This Is The Sound\" was released on June 30th 2017 and entered the top 100 charts in Switzerland, Germany, and the UK. In support of “This Is The Sound”, Cellar Darling toured three continents and more than 20 countries.<\/p>\r\n<p>Cellar Darling's second full-length concept album \"The Spell\" was released on March 22nd 2018, and it cemented the band firmly in the progressive music world. This ambitious release weaves a dark fairytale for the modern era, told through heavy yet intricate, progressive metal, enchanting visual art and utterly immersive storytelling. With this album, the trio decided to take their musical ideas and creativity a step further, and to create a concept album. It tells the tale of a girl who is birthed into a world full of pain, damaged and debilitated by the human beings that inhabit it. We follow her as she meets death and falls in love with him, trying desperately to join him – concluding with an ambiguous ending that leaves the listener wondering.<\/p>\r\n<p>On \"The Spell\" Cellar Darling have expanded their prog sound. Juxtaposing darkness and light, the album soars with melody, pummels with heavy passages and is peppered throughout with progressive flourishes, folky interludes and classical elements, as well as their use of hurdy gurdy and flute.<\/p>\r\n<p>“I think prog fits us best,” Merlin says. “Prog isn’t just about guitar solos, long songs or technical ability: for me, it’s pushing the limits of genre. We don’t want to set any boundaries for ourselves, and to me, that is the definition of progressive music.” But the ambition of \"The Spell\" doesn’t stop with the music and lyrics: Cellar Darling have created an audiobook that’s narrated by Anna to help complement the album’s story, and they enlisted Romanian graphic designer, Costin Chioreanu to create vivid illustrations and animated videos for every track. In September 2019 Cellar Darling won a Prog Award for Best Video of 2019 with “Insomnia”.<\/p>\r\n<p>The first part of a world tour for “The Spell” again saw the trio perform all over the world, including headline tours in the U.K., Latin America, and Europe in 2019. In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted Cellar Darling’s ongoing tour, resulting in the cancellation of more than 80 shows in Europe and North America. Following two live stream performances, in April and June of 2020, Cellar Darling retreated for the remainder of the year in order to write and record a new single. The 10-minute prog epic “DANCE” was released on 8 January 2021, followed by a music video on 23 March. Returning to the stage for just two shows in the fall of 2021, Cellar Darling are currently working on new music and are set to play only select live performances in 2022.<br \/> &nbsp;<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/cellar-darling\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=A8SukdPDCeQ","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"cellar_darling_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/cellar_darling_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27426}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2209,"uri":"https:\/\/www.cellardarling.com"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2210,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cellardarlingofficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2211,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/cellardarlingofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2212,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cellar_darling"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2213,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/cellardarling"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"29TiA5JlE8qI CyOYEvyvGR","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/0\/4\/csm_cellar_darling_2023_33df2f786e.jpg","uid":758}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Schweiz","uid":41}],"pathSegment":"cellar-darling","title":"Cellar Darling","uid":588}],"end":"1691083800","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2304","subtitle":"","title":"Wackinger Stage","uid":10},"start":"1691080200","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":972},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"eivor","pid":176,"title":"Eivor","uid":618},"biography":"<p>EIVØR wurde 1983 auf den Färöer Inseln geboren.

Nicht nur in verschiedenen Ländern fühlt sich EIVØR zu Hause, auch bei ihren Arrangements wechselt sie spielerisch zwischen verschiedenen Möglichkeiten ihres musikalischen Schaffens: So tritt sie mal als Solosängerin auf und begleitet sich selbst oder sie wird von ihrer Band unterstützt und präsentiert eine Mischung aus traditionellen Songs und ihren eigenen Kompositionen. Genauso wohl wie bei diesen Auftritten fühlt sie sich aber auch, wenn sie mit anderen Musikern zusammenarbeitet, die die unterschiedlichsten Hintergründe haben können. EIVØRs Stimme besticht dabei mit ganz außergewöhnlicher und charakteristischer Schönheit, ist einzigartig in ihrer Intimität, ihrer mühelosen Virtuosität und der Vielfalt an Färbungen. Gleichzeitig ist sie auch eine fesselnde Liveperformerin, die eine temperamentvolle und herzerwärmende Bühnenshow abliefert. Sie wird von der Presse auch als „Wikingergöttin“ beschrieben, die eine „außergewöhnliche Präsenz“ hat und Musik produziert, die „schmerzhaft schön“ ist. EIVØRs aktuelles Album „Segl“ (2020) ist das zehnte Album in Folge, nachdem 2015 das vielgelobte Debüt „Slør“ der äußerst produktiven Künstlerin erschien. Der Elektro-Folk-Pop der Musikerin wurde einem breiten Publikum bekannt durch Soundtracks zu „The Last Kingdom“, „Homeland“ und „Game of Thrones.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/eivor\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ivaOuUPB-Qc","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"eivor_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/eivor_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27528}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2328,"uri":"https:\/\/www.eivor.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2329,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/eivormusic\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2330,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/eivormusic\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2331,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/eivormusic"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2332,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCjKO6we36tPNC9hCeXUNvgQ"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"2dB4ya2W1Gvng8gjWSPu2H","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/9\/1\/csm_eivor_2023_869fabb4aa.jpg","uid":793}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Färöer","uid":71}],"pathSegment":"eivor","title":"Eivor","uid":618}],"end":"1691090100","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2304","subtitle":"","title":"Wackinger Stage","uid":10},"start":"1691086500","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":973},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"faun","pid":176,"title":"Faun","uid":567},"biography":"<p>Weltweit ausverkaufte Touren und begeisterte Konzertbesucher belegen, dass FAUN ein echtes Live-Erlebnis sind.

A super-team surrounding Marco.

RIOT CITY was also voted as one of the best newcomers by various media, while metal fans also supported the release and the band that already has completed two European tours and many festival appearances - with many more to follow supporting \"Electric Elite\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Following \"Burn The Night\", RIOT CITY are keeping their ripping and screaming heavy metal but also going one step further with the addition of US heavy and power metal elements to their heavy-speed JUDAS PRIEST-and-NWOBHM-inspired sound. Singer Jordan Jacobs handles lead vocals in the new album and the debut album's singer\/guitarist Cale Savy is now focused exclusively on lead guitars, while Roldan Reimer (guitars), Dustin Smith (bass) and Chad Vallier (drums) have a major contribution to the bombastic album. One can think of various influences and bands that have inspired RIOT CITY but here, we also have a strong vibe of originality bringing in mind the creation and the magic of classic '80s metal albums. The band's musicianship has evolved even more and everything has been worked in every single detail, keeping at the same time their passion for music. Once you listen to the new album, you can understand the RIOT CITY vibe from the first song, \"Eye of the Jaguar\", with the lightning-fast tempo, the guitar melodies and the over-the-edge singing. But there are also mid-paced songs such as \"Tyrant\" where you can also listen to how detailed and careful the guitar work is, including the solo parts. Few modern heavy metal bands have such anthemic guitar parts like RIOT CITY in songs like \"Lucky Diamond\". The element of melody is also stronger in the new album, something that's more than obvious in \"Ghost of Reality\" but also in the 10-minute closing epic track, \"Severed Ties\".<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Electric Elite\" was recorded by Antony Blaine at AB Studios in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

That’s why Screamer never strays far from the proven sound of roaring guitars and pounding drums that works equally well in the war pit in front of stage as when blasting through your stereo. In their music you can hear the classic foundations laid down by the hard rocking heroes of old. With a combination of straight-forward choruses of the likes of Dio, guitar works in the style of “Maiden or “Lizzy on speed and the pounding beat of Judas Priest, Screamer has carved out their very own essence of heavy metal that stands the test of time.<\/p>\r\n<p>With their latest album the songwriting has become even more focused and hard hitting. For the first time the band has been able to build on the last release with an intact set of members. This has really allowed them to build on their strengths and grow as a song writing unit. And, also for the first time, they’ve been working with an external producer, Gustav Hjortsjö from Bullet, who has really helped hone every song to be the best that they can be. Whether it’s the brutal Halo, the sing along friendly Out of the Dark or the anthem-like title track Highway of Heroes, all songs truly carry their own weight and together they fulfil the bands goal and war cry for this album; “All killers, no fillers”!<\/p>\r\n<p>This also goes hand in hand with Screamers continuous efforts to play their music for all and everyone who dares hear it. So far those efforts have had them playing on countless stages in North America, Japan and of course all around Europe! To this date Screamer been on tour with Bullet (2012 and 2018), Striker (2013), Evil Invaders (2013), Night Demon (2018), Satan (2019), RAM (2019) and many others.

And this is only mentioning a tiny portion of everything and everywhere they’ve played, by now they have well over 300 shows under their belt. And rest assured that whenever and wherever Screamer plays, they always deliver an energetic show and a good time!<\/p>\r\n<p>Still, they are not done yet by a long shot! Having previously released the albums Adrenaline Distractions (2011), Phoenix (2013) and Hell Machine (2017) on High Roller Records they have now decided to switch to The Sign Records for the latest album to get the ball rolling even faster!<\/p>\r\n<p>So grab a cold one, crank the stereo to eleven and join Screamer on an epic journey down the Highway of Heroes!<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/screamer\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RYdrsha7osQ","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"screamer_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/screamer_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27550}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2408,"uri":"https:\/\/wearescreamer.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2409,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wearescreamer\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2410,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/wearescreamer\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2411,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/wearescreamer"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2412,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/wearescreamer"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"3qcFxAxc0pzQklnjUKxPDk","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/a\/2\/csm_screamer_2023_b977552dd8.jpg","uid":815}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Schweden","uid":186}],"pathSegment":"screamer","title":"Screamer","uid":636}],"end":"1691088300","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691110800","start":"1691042400","title":"Thursday","uid":14},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2560","subtitle":"","title":"Wasteland Stage","uid":11},"start":"1691085600","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":979},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"raging-speedhorn","pid":176,"title":"Raging Speedhorn","uid":634},"biography":"<p>Since forming in 1998, Corby’s Raging Speedhorn have become infamous for their sledgehammer heavy albums and violent live shows. First single, \"Thumper\", produced by industrial veteran, Marc Heal, was released in 2000 to critical acclaim. In 2001 Speedhorn entered the UK Singles Chart at Number 50 with \"The Gush\". In 2002, they released their second album “We Will Be Dead Tomorrow”. Met with critical acclaim, “WWBDT” is Speedhorn’s most successful record to date. Videos for subsequent singles, “The Hate Song” &amp; “F*** The Voodooman”, received heavy rotation on Kerrang! TV &amp; MTV 2. Following its release, Speedhorn toured globally for the next two years, securing spots on major festivals like Reading &amp; Leeds and Download Festival.<br \/> The band followed up “WWBDT” with “How The Great Have Fallen” in 2005, which was released through Steamhammer\/SPV Records. Shortly after its release, vocalist Frank Regan left the band, and former Hard To Swallow frontman Bloody Kev joined. The band toured heavily through ‘05 &amp; ‘06, including a headline slot at Download Festival &amp; a US tour with Soilent Green, Nile, Hypocrisy &amp; Decapitated. The band released their fourth record, “Before The Sea Was Built” in September 2007. The band’s activity slowed over the next few months, and on March 25th 2008 announced their split after a final tour of Japan.<br \/> On February 18th 2014, Speedhorn announced their reformation, with vocalists Regan and John Loughlin returning. The line-up was rounded out with drummer Gordon Morison, bassist Dave Thompson &amp; guitarists Jay Thompson and Jim Palmer.

MODERN. METAL! These are the voyages of the visionary band AMARANTHE. Their ultimate mission: to explore the opaque realms between extreme metal and electronic tunes, to pioneer the invention of new approaches of joining two traditionally contradicting musical worlds, to boldly go where no metal band has gone before.<\/p>\r\n<p>Evolution requires visionaries. One of the biggest bangs of the modern metal universe happened in the fall of 2008.<\/p>\r\n<p>It was the Finland-based label Spinefarm Records that took the proverbial cake. In April 2011 the band released their eponymous debut album to worldwide acclaim, charting high in Sweden and Finland. Right off the bat tapping the vein of the digital music revolution, AMARANTHE was the 84th<\/p>\r\n<p>most played album on Spotify in the whole world, all genres included. After 92 live shows in support of the eponymous debut, AMARANTHE returned to their creative home, Hansen Studios in Ribe, Denmark where the magic of the debut album was originally bottled.<\/p>\r\n<p>With THE NEXUS album, released in March 2013, and its life cycle everything went up another notch: the album featured more of melodic \/ edgier metal, and even more brazenly techno-influenced hard rock. The release was followed by a longer tour, more and higher chart entries including a #12 position on the US Billboard Heatseekers chart. The band’s career was now officially on an ever-upward trajectory.<\/p>\r\n<p>Wasting no time, the band returned to Ribe to concoct another potion of power. Consequently, in October 2014 Spinefarm released the 3rd AMARANTHE outing, MASSIVE ADDICTIVE. Another step of progress both musically and commercially, the album charted in six countries, most notably claiming the band’s 1st pole position on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The album also yielded AMARANTHE’s first major single hit with “Drop Dead Cynical”, which stayed several weeks at the top of USA's premier rock station, Sirius XM Octane, and had massive airplay all around the world.<\/p>\r\n<p>One of the hardest working bands in the genre, the band released their 4th album MAXIMALISM already in October 2016. The album charted everywhere, taking home another #1 position on the Billboard Heatseekers, a Top 100 Billboard &amp; chart position #3 in Finland. Four albums into their career, AMARANTHE have racked up north of 118 million YouTube views, half a billion song streams, are the three-time holder of BillBoard Heatseekers Chart #1 position and possess a panoply of Gold discs for albums and singles alike.<\/p>\r\n<p>Deservedly revered as trailblazers of the genre, AMARANTHE, ever the visionaries, always seem to take the next bold step into realms unknown before anyone else does. AMARANTHE is the driving force of a modern metal revolution.<\/p>\r\n<p>With their electrifying 5th album HELIX now on the brink of its release AMARANTHE take another leap in their sonic evolution. Their most focused work to date, Helix proves the band has refined their melodic sensibilities ever further whilst retaining their cutting-edge metal assault as massively aggressive as ever.<\/p>\r\n<p>From the 365’s seductively velvety mix of contemporary sounds and modern metal to the driving grooves of Countdown and Breakthrough Starshot; the heart-rending honesty of the emotive ballad Unified to the flawlessly flowing raps of Dream and GG6’s blistering extreme metal throw-down, every song on Helix is a potential hit. Once again a quantum leap ahead of their peers, AMARANTHE aces everything they do.<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, armed with an album with unprecedented crossover potential, AMARANTHE is ready to tear down the walls of musical separation. Get ready for a sonic revolution!<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/amaranthe\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-A7BPXEBh1Q","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"amaranthe_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/amaranthe_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27273}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2075,"uri":"https:\/\/www.amaranthe.se\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2076,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AmarantheBand\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2077,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/amarantheofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2078,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCuRZjIZcbcdfhixsE1V3E0A"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2079,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/amaranthemetal"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"2KaW48xlLnXC2v8tvyhWsa","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/3\/e\/csm_amaranthe_2023_35a22adbab.jpg","uid":725}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Schweden","uid":186}],"pathSegment":"amaranthe","title":"Amaranthe","uid":563}],"end":"1691154000","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"512","subtitle":"","title":"Faster","uid":4},"start":"1691150400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":985},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"trivium","pid":176,"title":"Trivium","uid":538},"biography":"","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/trivium\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ybekW8fZHH0","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"trivium2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/trivium2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27183}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1957,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Trivium\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":1958,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/triviumband\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":1959,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TriviumOfficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1960,"uri":"https:\/\/www.trivium.org\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"3qq44o8Qqvz5JQ7b5AevLT","spotifyartist":"278ZYwGhdK6QTzE3MFePnP","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/b\/0\/csm_trivium2023_6d21e19a3b.jpg","uid":696}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika","uid":220}],"pathSegment":"trivium","title":"Trivium","uid":538}],"end":"1691163000","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"512","subtitle":"","title":"Faster","uid":4},"start":"1691159400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":986},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"megadeth","pid":176,"title":"Megadeth","uid":531},"biography":"<p>It was over 30 years ago that Dave Mustaine founded <strong>MEGADETH<\/strong>, in the process pioneering the sound that would become known the world over as thrash metal. And from the very beginning, the band proved to be the most lethal and audacious unit on the heavy music scene, pushing thrash to the limits of musical ferocity and instrumental virtuosity on early efforts like their 1985 debut, <em>Killing Is My Business…And Business Is Good!<\/em> and 1986’s seminal <em>Peace Sells…But Who’s Buying?<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the decades since, <strong>MEGADETH<\/strong>&nbsp;have taken their place as one of metal’s most influential and respected acts—not to mention among its most successful. They have gone on to sell more than 38 million albums worldwide, earning numerous accolades including a 2017 GRAMMY® Award for “Best Metal Performance” for the title track “Dystopia,” 12 GRAMMY® nominations, and scoring five consecutive platinum albums. With sheer determination and a relentless recording and touring schedule,&nbsp;<strong>MEGADETH&nbsp;<\/strong>worked their way up from headlining clubs to headlining arenas, festival and stadiums, cementing a legacy that continues to grow and spread throughout the world.<\/p>\r\n<p>The band’s beginning started in 1984, Dave Mustaine was determined to start a new band that would be heavier and faster than his peers. Mustaine’s songwriting was rapidly maturing, and he set about combining the attitude and energy of punk, with the power and intricate riffing of metal, along with direct, sociopolitical lyrical content. With David Ellefson on bass and Gar Samuelson on drums, the band recorded their infamous 3-song demo which quickly circulated through the underground tape-trading circuit and became an underground hit leading to a deal with Combat Records.&nbsp;The band’s 1985 debut&nbsp;Killing Is My Business…And Business Is Good, was the album that would lay down the blueprint and establish&nbsp;<strong>MEGADETH<\/strong>&nbsp;as one of the four pioneers, known as the “Big Four,” who virtually invented a genre with their debut album lauded by VH1 as the “Greatest Thrash Metal Debut Album of All Time”.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>MEGADETH<\/strong>&nbsp;was quickly signed by Capitol Records and released their 1986 major label debut&nbsp;Peace Sells…But Who’s Buying?, which became the band’s first certified gold record and would go on to become <strong>MEGADETH<\/strong>’s first platinum selling release which&nbsp;<em>Pitchfork<\/em>&nbsp;describes as “everything great about hardcore, plus a dose of the kind of show-off skill that makes lesser musicians' fingers bleed.” They followed with their platinum selling&nbsp;So Far, So Good, So What! (1988); GRAMMY® nominated, platinum album&nbsp;Rust In Peace&nbsp;(1990) featuring “Hanger 18” and “Holy Wars…The Punishment Due;” 1992 GRAMMY® nominated, double platinum release&nbsp;Countdown To Extinction &nbsp;with singles “Symphony of Destruction” and “Sweating Bullets”;&nbsp;“A Tout Le Monde” and “Reckoning Day” from their 1994 platinum selling release&nbsp;Youthanasia; “Kingmaker” from their 2013 Top Ten release&nbsp;Super Collider, which hit No. 3 on both the&nbsp;<em>Hard Rock Albums<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Top Rock Albums<\/em>&nbsp;charts. “She-Wolf” was from the GRAMMY® nominated, Top Ten release&nbsp;Cryptic Writings&nbsp;(1997).<\/p>\r\n<p>In 2016 <strong>MEGADETH<\/strong> once again reinvented themselves as the legendary metal outfit, led by visionary singer, guitarist and songwriter Dave Mustaine, and released their 15<sup>th<\/sup> studio effort <em>Dystopia<\/em>, which debuted at No. 3 on the <em>Billboard Top 200<\/em>, No. 1 on the <em>Hard Music\/Top Rock Chart<\/em>, No. 2 on the <em>Top Album Sales<\/em> chart, No. 2 on iTtunes’ <em>Top Albums<\/em> chart and No 1. on iTunes’ <em>Metal<\/em> chart. The title track “Dystopia” went on to win a 2017 GRAMMY® Award for “Best Metal Performance.” The album, which saw Mustaine once again joined by stalwart bassist David Ellefson, was the first <strong>MEGADETH<\/strong> effort to feature new guitarist Kiko Louriero and drummer Chris Adler, the latter on loan from Lamb of God. Together, they inject new levels of musical venom and instrumental dexterity into what was already a wickedly potent brew.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since its release, <strong>MEGADETH<\/strong> had been touring around the world non-stop in support of <em>Dystopia<\/em>, adding Dirk Verbeuren as <strong>MEGADETH<\/strong>’s fulltime drummer.<\/p>\r\n<p>In between tour legs, the band had been in the studio writing and recording when late last year, <strong>MEGADETH<\/strong>’s plans were temporarily sidelined when Mustaine was diagnosed with cancer.

In this past period leading up to the release, it has been truly overwhelming to see how well you have received the songs we have shared so far. We sincerely hope you will enjoy the rest! For me personally, this album represents a natural continuation and development of everything we have done so far. Through experience, reflection and hungry curiosity, we potentially continue to grow as humans, scholars and musicians and with this constant movement, our ability to dive deeper into our work also grows. More clearly than before, does this album and its songs address us as humans in our own time. And even though the songs convey ways and words originating from a distant past, they are still just as much ways and words for the “now”. They are ideas born out of the very grounds we still tread, which is also what gives them the ability to speak to- and resonate within us still. Let us listen carefully, and sow or reaffirm the idea or attitude that nature is something sacred.”<\/em><strong> <\/strong>-Einar-<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Kvitravn<\/em> marks a distinct evolution in Wardruna's sound. The album features a broad selection of both traditional and historical instruments such as Kravik-lyre, Trossingen-lyre, Taglharpa, Sotharpa, Langeleik, Crwth, Goat-horn, Lur, Bronze-lur, flute, Moraharpa and the record also features guest appearances by a small group of prominent traditional singers, spearheaded by Kirsten Bråten Berg, one of the most important custodians of Norwegian traditional song. Throughout eleven songs, <em>Kvitravn<\/em> discusses Northern sorcery, spirit-animals, shadows, nature and animism, the wisdom and meanings of certain myths, various Norse spiritual concepts, and the relation between sage and songs.<\/p>\r\n<p>The authenticity of their performance, the epic visual landscapes and symbolic animals evoked by the music and lyrics have been showcased in several jaw-dropping videos - some reaching viewers in their millions. Starting with the starkly beautiful, minimalist and arguably most political piece, \"Grá\" - an ode to the wolf, and a reminder that humans and creatures have existed side-by-side in a mutual, though wary, relationship.&nbsp; The video for the title track \"Kvitravn\" reveals a powerful narrative centred around this sacred, elusive creature, and namesake of the album. Einar Selvik revealed in a special Solstice broadcast of the Skaldic version of album track \"Andvevarljod - Song of the Spirit-weavers\" that this particular piece was the starting point for the entire album, and explores the Nordic deities of fate; the Norns, the spinning of life threads and the Norse and Sámi common idea that a person's spirit is connected to wind, both before and after birth. Most recently the lyric video for \"Skugge\", recalling the subtle majesty of fan-favourite \"Helvegen, gazes inward, about seeking answers and wisdom internally. Finally, stand-alone single \"Lyfjaberg\" (not appearing on the album) is a powerful reminder of some valuable Norse wisdom, <em>\"To climb the Healing-mountain is a journey for the mind and spirit as much as the feet and body. Anything of true value, comes at a true cost.\"<\/em> - Einar Selvik<\/p>\r\n<p>For those looking to delve even deeper into Wardruna's world, we recommend a four part mini-documentary series which can be viewed on the band's Youtube channel. In these four short pieces, Einar guides the viewer more deeply into the thoughts, processes and inspiration behind the music.&nbsp;<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/wardruna\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H6RCY-G-NlA","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"wardruna-2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/wardruna-2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27088}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1932,"uri":"https:\/\/www.wardruna.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1933,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wardruna"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":1934,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/wardruna\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":1935,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/wardruna"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"0NJ6wlOAsAJ1PN4VRdTPKA","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/b\/d\/csm_wardruna-2023_69e2a5f1cf.jpg","uid":687}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Norwegen","uid":158}],"pathSegment":"wardruna","title":"Wardruna","uid":532}],"end":"1691188200","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"512","subtitle":"","title":"Faster","uid":4},"start":"1691183700","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":988},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"kaerbholz","pid":176,"title":"Kärbholz","uid":57},"biography":"<p>KÄRBHOLZ - LIVE …<\/p>\r\n<p>… das ist Vollgas Rock´n´Roll und eine gute Zeit, das ist laut aber auch mal leise und in jedem Fall grundehrlich und ein Abend, der in Erinnerung bleibt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Handgemachte Musik mit Schnörkel, Kante und einem feinen Gespür für den Moment.<\/p>\r\n<p>Keine Playbacks, kein Getöse und vielleicht auch keine Melodien für Millionen, vielmehr der Anspruch, jeden Abend, jeden Moment einzigartig zu machen.<\/p>\r\n<p>Der letzte Longplayer „Überdosis Leben“ ging aus dem Stand auf #2 der deutschen Albumcharts, die folgende Tour bescherte der Band ausverkaufte Häuser quer durch das Land und vor allem: ein noch festeres Band zwischen Band und Publikum.<\/p>\r\n<p>Eine Überdosis in allen Belangen, im positivsten Sinne!<\/p>\r\n<p>Packt Eure beste Laune und die Tanzschuhe ein und besucht ein Konzert in Eurer Nähe.<\/p>\r\n<p>So mancher Vogel pfeift es schon vom Dach: Ist es nicht etwa eh schon wieder Zeit für neuen musikalischen Output aus dem Hause Holz?!<\/p>\r\n<p>Wir werden es erleben in 2019!<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/kaerbholz\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=icTctrQpqAY","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":false,"title":"WOA 2019","uid":1},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"kaerbholz-2019.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2019\/kaerbholz-2019.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":22832}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":208,"uri":"https:\/\/www.kaerbholz.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":209,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Kaerbholzoffiziell\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":210,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kaerbholz\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":211,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kaerbholz"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"7LNFSNejKjCEEwneXJQwXL","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/6\/5\/csm_kaerbholz-2019_fd963ef18a.jpg","uid":58},{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"kaerbholz","pid":176,"title":"Kärbholz","uid":57},"biography":"<p class=\"Text\">18 Jahre werden es 2023 bei den 4 Freunden von Kärbholz aus dem beschaulichen Ruppichteroth.Es ist viel passiert in den letzten Jahren „Rastlos“ (#16 in 2013), \"Karma“ (#7 in 2015), „Überdosis Leben“ (#2 in 2017), \"Herz und Verstand” (#3 in 2019) und “Kontra.” (#4 in 2021).

Putting all their energy into making the best album they could, Sleeps decided that when it came to naming album four, typically, they weren’t going to play along with the usual music stereotypes.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>“‘SO WHAT?’ is about how easily we all judge everything before we actually know anything about it,”<\/em> explains Mat. <em>“If we put a really elaborate title on a record with a really elaborate cover, that could give you the option of deciding what you think of it before you’ve listened to anything on it. The one thing we’re putting every bit of our creative juice into is the music.”<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recorded with producer Carl Bown, ‘SO WHAT?’ promises to be another defiant step forwards. <em>“It’s going to blow your mind!”<\/em> promises Mat, and if first single ‘Anti-Social’ is anything to go by, he isn’t kidding. An explosive, relentless four-minute anthem, it takes everything you know and love about While She Sleeps – clattering riffs, bruising breakdowns, snarling lyrics and big-ass singalongs – and sticks them in a blender. It’s punk, it’s heavy metal, it couldn’t be any other band but them, and yet it sounds unlike anything you’ve heard from them before. It’s the sound of While She Sleeps reborn. <em>“It’s still very different – as much as it still sounds like While She Sleeps,”<\/em> agrees Sean. <em>“You get a taste of this new area that we’re flowing into. Even though it’s still really heavy, you get this twinge of what’s to come.”<\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“We felt excited about Anti-Social,”<\/em> notes Mat. <em>“It’s such a heavy tune, but it’s a different way of heavy than we’ve been before. It feels like you want to be out and drunk, throwing beer over your mates while it’s on. In a world where everyone expects you to be softening up or getting more generic, I think it’s fun to just throw out a song that’s just, like, ‘Nope! We’re not doing that!’”<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Set for release on Sleeps Brothers in collaboration with metal mega-label Spinefarm, ‘SO WHAT?’ sees While She Sleeps working with a major label again for the first time since 2015’s ‘Brainwashed’, and the band are at pains to point out that this won’t mean there’ll be any compromise in their vision. “<em>We got approached immediately by a bunch of labels, but we turned around to all of them and said, ‘The only way we’re going to do anything is if you let us release it on Sleeps Brothers, but you house that on your train, and we make the decisions behind everything,” <\/em>Mat explains. <em>“I fucking loved releasing You Are We ourselves, but at the same time, I played more on my laptop than I did on my guitar for the whole campaign. This release is a partnership between Sleeps Brothers and Spinefarm, but no one is breathing down our necks about the record we’re making or the singles we’re putting out.” <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a bigger platform to get their music into the world and a firestorm of a first single released, 2019 is shaping up to be the year of While She Sleeps. For a band that have spent over a decade redefining modern metal, it seems the best is yet to come.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/while-she-sleeps\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-G-0VhK4OtQ","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"while_she_sleeps_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/while_she_sleeps_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27282}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2117,"uri":"https:\/\/www.whileshesleeps.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2118,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/whileshesleeps"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2119,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/whileshesleeps"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2120,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/whileshesleeps\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2121,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/whileshesleeps1"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"38LdIuxB548zgHoEY2AN7a","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/9\/1\/csm_while_she_sleeps_2023_38454b61eb.jpg","uid":734}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Großbritannien","uid":74}],"pathSegment":"while-she-sleeps","title":"While She Sleeps","uid":285}],"end":"1691158500","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"768","subtitle":"","title":"Harder","uid":5},"start":"1691154900","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":990},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"santiano","pid":176,"title":"Santiano","uid":75},"biography":"<p>Wenn sie auf die Bühne gehen, dann kreischen die Möwen, dann peitscht der Wind, dann bäumt sich das Schiff im Sturm auf. Egal ob in Flensburg am Meer oder in München, weit weg vom Salzwasser - SANTIANO live ist eine Naturgewalt. Deutschlands erfolgreichste Band steht seit ihrer Gründung für Mannschaftsgeist und den Glauben an höhere Ziele. Auf dem vierten Studio Album loten SANTIANO die Grenzen ihrer Welt aus: Seite an Seite mit den großen Entdeckern und Abenteurern der Geschichte stoßen die Männer aus dem Norden dabei ohne Scheu bis in die Tiefen der Meere vor.<\/p>\r\n<p>Wenn SANTIANO auf Tour ist, dann machen sie keine halben Sachen, das kann jeder in ihrem „Logbuch“ nachlesen, das die Band schon seit 2013 für ihre Fans führt. Dort zeigt sich oft genug per Videobotschaft, was vor und hinter der Bühne auf einem Konzert von SANTIANO passiert. Dass sich am Spaß der Mannschaft rein gar nichts geändert hat, dass sie noch immer scherzen, improvisieren, mit dem Publikum auf Tuchfühlung gehen und unterwegs manche Panne verfluchen.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Nur die Häfen, welche die Santiano anläuft, haben sich über die Jahre geändert. Und so spielt die Band mittlerweile in den größten Arenen des Landes regelmäßig vor ausverkauften Häusern. Mit dem phänomenalen Konzert in der Berliner Waldbühne im Sommer 2016 haben SANTIANO einen weiteren Meilenstein in ihrer Karriere gesetzt. 2013 noch als Vorband von Helene Fischer, füllt sich drei Jahre später die legendäre Freilichtbühne mit über 20.000 SANTIANO-Fans.<\/p>\r\n<p>Eines wird klar, wenn man die Bilder und die Musik aus der Waldbühne auf sich wirken lässt: So vielseitig sich das Publikum von SANTIANO zeigt, Metalheads neben Großeltern mit ihren Enkeln, Familien, Paare oder ganze Cliquen - bei SANTIANO trennt sie nichts. Sie singen aus voller Kehle, lachen und tanzen und feiern gemeinsam mit der Band ihr Fest. Die Band besitzt die Gabe, in den richtigen Momenten aufs Tempo zu drücken, zum richtigen Zeitpunkt inne zu halten und genau an der richtigen Stelle wieder in den Sturm zu steuern. Das macht nicht nur vor Ort Spaß, sondern ist auch beim zweiten und dritten Mal ein echtes Erlebnis.<\/p>\r\n<p>SANTIANO setzen in allen Bereichen der hiesigen Musiklandschaft Maßstäbe:&nbsp; Seien es ihre allesamt auf Nummer-1 der Charts platzierten Alben oder ihre legendären Konzert-Tourneen. 7-fach Gold und 3-fach Platin - das sind Auszeichnungen, die nur Musikalben der Ausnahmeklasse erreichen. Santiano haben solch ein Ausnahme-Album auf die Beine gestellt. „Von Liebe, Tod und Freiheit“ das Vorgängeralbum wurde 2015 veröffentlicht und im Kreise des Teams und der Plattenfirma veredelt.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;„Im Auge des Sturms“ wird als Album aber auch LIVE einen weiteren Meilenstein in der Geschichte von SANTIANO markieren.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/santiano\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hh5d9x5UZlE","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":false,"title":"WOA 2019","uid":1},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"santiano-2019.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2019\/santiano-2019.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":22897}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":271,"uri":"https:\/\/www.universal-music.de\/santiano\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":272,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SantianoMusik\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":273,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCuh73pKNhAeqgHlPlPhyoyA"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"6E9zde1CFsBtKI66OEHkk3","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/b\/0\/csm_santiano-2019_a1159f7ad7.jpg","uid":76},{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"santiano","pid":176,"title":"Santiano","uid":75},"biography":"<p>Eine Dekade voller großartiger Erfolge, ausverkaufter Konzerthallen mit phänomenalen Live-<br \/> Erlebnissen sind Grund genug, um dieses Jubiläum gebührend zu feiern.

Over the course of 46 years they have come to embody a spirit of fearless creative independence, ferocious dedication to their fans, and a cheerful indifference to their critics that’s won them a following that spans every culture, generation, and time-zone. A story of gritty determination and courageous defiance of the naysayers, theirs has been an adventure like no other, and with Senjutsu, their upcoming seventeenth album the marvellous adventure continues, and what a story it has been. With over 100 million record sales, more than 2000 live performances in 63* countries, tens of millions of fans and 16 going on 17 studio albums of unerring quality and power to their name, Iron Maiden have more than earned their proudly-held status as one of the most influential and revered rock bands of all time.<\/p>\r\n<p>Founded by bassist Steve Harris in the mid ‘70s, Iron Maiden were already firmly established as heavy metal’s brightest hopes when they stormed the world with their third album (and first with vocalist Bruce Dickinson) The Number Of The Beast in 1982. It would kick off a decade of classic releases and dogged touring that would come to epitomise the unrelenting, uncompromising, unswerving commitment they are now so well known for. That marvellous decade would also yield seven new studio albums, one live album, seven World Tours, as well as the creation of Eddie - one of the most iconic and recognisable figureheads of our age and the calling card of the most impassioned fan-bases anywhere.<\/p>\r\n<p>What makes these qualities even more notable is that they developed almost entirely without the acknowledgement of mainstream media. While celebrity culture and the next big thing occupied the airwaves, Iron Maiden were embarking on the marathon 192-date 1984\/5 World Slavery tour, playing at Rock In Rio in 1985, and mounting a command performance at the biggest-ever Monsters Of Rock festival at Donington in 1988 with 107,000 fans in attendance. But it’s really Iron Maiden’s iron-clad resolve to always push the boundaries that gives their career such astonishing distinction. From groundbreaking performances in Poland behind the Iron Curtain in 1984 at the height of the Cold War, around South America in 1991, through the Middle East and India in 2007, and Indonesia in 2011 among many others, Iron Maiden’s relentless forward momentum has left an indelible impression on the globe.<\/p>\r\n<p>The ‘90s proved to be a difficult time for heavy metal bands in general, but Iron Maiden ploughed forward, notching up yet more success with albums like 1992’s acclaimed Fear Of The Dark and even weathering the departure of Bruce Dickinson in 1993. The band made two strong albums with new singer Blaze Bayley and continued to honour their commitment to intensive touring. However, it was the return of Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith (who originally left the band in 1990) in 1999 when Iron Maiden became a six-piece, that established the ultimate Iron Maiden line-up of Bruce Dickinson on vocals, Steve Harris on bass, Nicko McBrain on drums and “the three amigos” – Adrian Smith, Dave Murray and Janick Gers - on guitar, heralding a new golden age with the release of the Brave New World album in 2000. With both 2003’s diverse and ingenious Dance Of Death album and its dark and daring follow-up, 2006’s A Matter Of Life And Death, they dazzled fans and critics alike. With each successive tour, whether revisiting classic songs from their first few albums or refusing to succumb to a nostalgia by playing A Matter Of Life And Death in its entirety, Maiden have accrued countless new young admirers by never being predictable while remaining predictably brilliant.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;This brave new Maiden era reached an astonishing zenith during the band’s Somewhere Back In Time Tour that began in February 2008 and initially took the band 50,000 miles around the world in 45 days, flying in their own specially chartered Boeing 757, Ed Force One, piloted by Bruce Dickinson, a qualified airline captain, traversing the planet, from India to Costa Rica, Australia to Argentina, Sao Paulo to Tokyo. Ed Force One made TV news headlines around the world and the coverage of that tour was subsequently turned into an award-winning film and DVD Flight 666. Released in 2009, that stunning document of life on the road (and in the air) hit the No.1 slot in the music DVD charts in 25 countries, the same year the band picked up their first ever Brit Award for Best British Live Act.<\/p>\r\n<p>More feats would follow - from reaching the number one spot in more than 28 countries simultaneously as well as reaching an all-time high of #4 on the Billboard with 2010’s The Final Frontier album, to the ensuing tour aboard Ed Force One which saw them hitting five continents in 66 days, to earning their first ever U.S. Grammy for Best Metal Performance for the song El Dorado, Iron Maiden’s most recent chapter is testament to their startling vitality.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 2013 the Maiden England world tour took the band into Europe, the States, and South America, most notably hitting Brazil yet again for Rock In Rio which sold out 90,000 tickets within hours. That legendary year also saw a return to UK’s Donington Park on the 25th Anniversary of the band’s legendary headline 1988 performance during the Seventh Son World Tour.<\/p>\r\n<p>Iron Maiden closed their Maiden England world tour in July 2014 headlining at Sonisphere Festival, Knebworth, delighting the crowds by having The Great War Display Team featuring Bruce Dickinson among its pilots, stage a sensational aerial dogfight in the skies above the Festival with Bruce flying his very own WW1 German Fokker Dr1, just hours before taking to the stage. The ensuing Maiden show marked the final chapter in the band’s trilogy of tours performing their 80’s repertoire.<\/p>\r\n<p>2016\/17 saw the band once again take to the road and the skies on tour with their 16th and first-ever studio double album, The Book Of Souls, a 92-minute masterpiece debuting at number one in the album charts of 43 countries, a rare occurence in today’s music industry, and a cannon-blast of exuberant, anthemic bravado that serves as cast-iron confirmation of just how much Maiden have left in the tank. This tour, with Ed Force One upgraded to a larger and more powerful model - a 747 Jumbo Jet piloted by Bruce Dickinson - enabled the band to reach over two million fans in six continents visiting 39 countries including first-ever performances in China, El Salvador and Lithuania. It also denoted a record sixth-time return to headline at Donington following two Monsters of Rock performances (1988 and 1992) and three Download Festivals (2003, 2007 and 2013), delighting fans who witnessed the band disembarking Ed Force One after landing at East Midlands airport, directly adjacent to the Festival site.<\/p>\r\n<p>2018 and Maiden’s latest Legacy Of The Beast Tour is being hailed by fans and media alike as the most extravagant and visually stunningly live show of the band’s career to date. Both the production and the decades-spanning set-list of fan favourites and hits were inspired by their mobile phone game of the same name.&nbsp; The multi-themed concert opens with a replica Spitfire flying above the stage and progresses through a two-hour theatrical journey of ever-evolving interlocking stage sets with multiple incarnations of Eddie, pyrotechnics and special effects including muskets, claymores, flame throwers, a giant electrified crucifix, a noose, gallows and a gargantuan Icarus to name just a few.<\/p>\r\n<p>Only a global pandemic could draw a halt to Iron Maiden’s momentum and relentless touring schedule, but they were busy behind the scenes. November 2020 saw the release of their latest double live album Nights Of The Dead, Legacy Of The Beast: Live In Mexico City, a celebration of their current Legacy Of The Beast tour, selling out headline stadiums, arenas and festival shows across Europe and North, South and Central America to close to two million fans. Little did those fans know that an even bigger story was about to unfold: Senjutsu, Iron Maiden’s first new music to be released in six years. Out on September 3rd and spearheaded by the groundbreaking video for The Writing On The Wall, let there be no doubt: Maiden are back, and there are exciting times ahead.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/iron-maiden\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WxnN05vOuSM","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"iron-maiden-2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/iron-maiden-2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27084}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1919,"uri":"https:\/\/www.ironmaiden.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1920,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ironmaiden"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":1921,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ironmaiden\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":1922,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IronMaiden"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"6mdiAmATAx73kdxrNrnlao","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/5\/a\/csm_iron-maiden-2023_0d79a6294e.jpg","uid":684}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Großbritannien","uid":74}],"pathSegment":"iron-maiden","title":"Iron Maiden","uid":530}],"end":"1691182800","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"768","subtitle":"","title":"Harder","uid":5},"start":"1691175600","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":992},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"lord-of-the-lost","pid":176,"title":"Lord Of The Lost","uid":543},"biography":"","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/lord-of-the-lost\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/eRozMNIXGhw","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"lord_of_the_lost2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/lord_of_the_lost2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27189}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1984,"uri":"https:\/\/www.lordofthelost.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1985,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lordofthelost\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":1986,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/officiallordofthelost\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":1987,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCKmi2SZRPoCqXA01qtzIqrw"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"7spmR1GhxuilZA5sa9YSHY","spotifyartist":"28eLrVsohdXynlnIzQ2VvI","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/c\/4\/csm_lord_of_the_lost2023_881331c81a.jpg","uid":702}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"lord-of-the-lost","title":"Lord Of The Lost","uid":543}],"end":"1691193600","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"768","subtitle":"","title":"Harder","uid":5},"start":"1691189100","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":993},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"jbo","pid":176,"title":"J.B.O.","uid":344},"biography":"<p>J.B.O. formierte sich im Jahr des Herrn 1989, ein paar Wochen, nachdem sich die beiden “Frontmänner” Hannes “G.Laber” Holzmann und Vito C. kennen gelernt hatten, unter dem Namen “James Blast Orchester”. Ihren bereits im Vorfeld legendären, ersten Auftritt hatten sie im Oktober ’89 auf dem alljährlichen Erlanger Newcomerfestival – Ein musikalisches Desaster, was jedoch den Unterhaltungswert der Vorstellung nicht schmälerte. Das Programm bestand in erster Linie aus umgetexteten Cover-Versionen, auf 180 vorgetragen, garniert mit kabarettistischen Einlagen. Die Farbe des Bühnen-Outfits war von Anfang an Schwarz-Rosa-Gold.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fünf Jahre lang war J.B.O. nur ein Spaß-Projekt. Alle Mitglieder versuchten mit anderen Bands reich und berühmt zu werden. Diese anderen Bands waren zumindest so erfolgreich, dass man davon seinen Lebensunterhalt bestreiten konnte. J.B.O. wurde alle paar Monate zum reinen Jokus der Beteiligten auf die Bühne gerufen.<\/p>\r\n<p>1994 lief “Ein guter Tag zum Sterben” – eines der bis dahin wenigen eigenen Stücke von J.B.O. – in der örtlichen Radiostation rauf und runter. Da es sich nur um ein 4-Spur-Demotape handelte, aber andauernd Leute beim Sender anriefen, die eine nicht vorhandene CD der Band erstehen wollten, beschloss J.B.O., diesen Zustand zu ändern. In einem Tag und zwei Nächten spielten sie die EP “Eine gute CD zum Kaufen” ein, die verschiedene regionale Verkaufsrekorde aufstellte. Die zweite EP “Blastphemie” verstand sich als ein lustiges Weihnachtsgeschenk für die bereits zahlreichen fränkischen Fans.<\/p>\r\n<p>Zum eigentlichen Schlag holten die Pink-Metaller im Jahr 1995 aus. Im September des Jahres veröffentlichten sie ihren ersten Longplayer mit dem Titel “Explizite Lyrik”. Eine CD randvoll mit den Gehirnblähungen der ersten 6 Jahre – 20 Tracks, 74 Minuten. Erschienen beim Independent Label “Musical Tragedies”, gab es für diese CD so gut wie kein Marketing. Dennoch verkauften sich “aus Versehen” in den ersten 3 Monaten über 10.000 Exemplare, was ein ums andere Mal ein Lächeln auf die verdutzten Gesichter der Band zauberte.<\/p>\r\n<p>Als die CD im Sommer ’96 dann auch noch die deutschen LP-Charts knackte, wich das Lächeln einem breiten Grinsen. Das verging J.B.O. auch nicht, als die Anwälte von James Last ihnen den Namen verbieten wollten. Man kürzte denselben einfach ab und grinste weiter. Den Charts blieb man etliche Wochen treu.<\/p>\r\n<p>Natürlich war die große Musikindustrie inzwischen auf die wüsten rosa Spaßmacher aufmerksam geworden. Trotz vollmundiger Angebote entschieden sich J.B.O. für die Business-Ikone Hage Hein, der mit seinem kleinen Label “Lawine” an die BMG angeschlossen war. Der erste “Major-Release” erklomm unter dem Titel “Laut!” die LP-Charts hoch bis zum Platz 13. Unabhängig von ihren CD’s war J.B.O. immer bekannt für spektakuläre Live-Auftritte. Gottseidank hatten die vier Musiker in den Jahren auch endlich gelernt, ihre Instrumente zu bedienen. 1996 begannen sie bundesweit zu touren. 1997 spielten sie 100 Konzerte vor zusammengerechnet über 100.000 Leuten.<\/p>\r\n<p>1998 erschien der in Italien produzierte Longplayer “Meister der Musik”, der sich sogar zwei Wochen lang in den deutschen Top Ten halten konnte. Spätestens ab diesem Zeitpunkt war klar, dass J.B.O.’s eigene Songs den Cover-Versionen in keinster Weise zurückstanden.<\/p>\r\n<p>1999 stand ganz im Zeichen von “10 Jahre Blödsinn”. J.B.O. feierten ihren 10ten Geburtstag mit einem großen Festival und vielen befreundeten Bands in der fränkischen Heimat.<br \/> Die Jahrtausendwende veränderte Alles: Anfang 2000 erklärten Schmitti und Holmer “a Bier” Graap ihren Ausstieg aus der Band. Beide wollten nicht ihr komplettes Leben dem Rock’n’Roll-Dasein widmen – anders als Hannes und Vito, die sich nichts anderes vorstellen konnten. Da alle Texte, Ideen und Songs aus ihrer Feder stammten, entschieden sie, jetzt erst recht weiterzumachen und suchten sich zwei neue Mitstreiter, die ihnen in musikalischer Hinsicht ebenbürtig waren\/sind. Diese Entwicklung vollzog sich während der Produktion ihres vierten Albums “Sex Sex Sex”, das zwar noch mit den “alten” Mitgliedern eingespielt, aber bereits mit den “neuen” live präsentiert wurde.<\/p>\r\n<p>Der neue Schlagzeuger heißt Wolfram Kellner und ist ein alter Klassenkamerad von Vito. Er spielte vorher bei der befreundeten Band “Fiddler’s Green”. Mit dem neuen Bassist Ralph Bach streckten die Erlanger ihre imperialistischen Arme bis nach Nürnberg aus. Beide Neuzugänge gaben dem rosa Quartett den entscheidenden Tritt in den Hintern und der Live-Performance eine neue Dimension. Das konnten die Fans im Jahr 2001 auf 96 Konzerten nicht nur hören sondern auch sehen. Im September des Jahres präsentierte man dies auch stolz auf der ersten Live-Scheibe mit dem Titel “Live-Sex”.<\/p>\r\n<p>Ab Februar 2002 verschanzte sich J.B.O. auf dem Balkan, um an ihrem fünften Studio-Album zu arbeiten, das im September 2002 unter dem Titel “<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rosaarmeefraktion.de\/\">Rosa Armee Fraktion<\/a>” erschien und wie der Vorgänger auf Platz 13 der LP-Charts einschlug. Unter der Devise “Ich will Lärm” machten sich die Vier im Herbst auf große Deutschland-Rundreise, bei der sie erfuhren, dass das Interesse an ihren Konzerten nicht gesunken war. Im Winter beglückten sie auch wieder das deutschsprachige Ausland, inklusive Luxemburg und Belgien.<\/p>\r\n<p>Im Frühjahr 2003 wurde die Tour fortgesetzt, wobei sich erstmals auffällig nicht-deutschsprachige Fans unter den Tross mischten… eine Gruppe Franzosen aus der Gegend um Paris reiste unter schwarz-rosa-goldener Flagge bis nach Hannover oder Oldenburg. Die Musik von J.B.O. scheint wohl auch ohne Textverständnis Spaß zu machen. Dies belegen auch Briefe und Mails aus Thailand, Indien, Japan, dem Iran, Sibirien, oder Südamerika, die immer wieder eintreffen. Die Auftritte auf den Festivals “With Full Force” und “Summer Breeze” bezeugten einmal mehr die Live-Qualitäten der Band – obwohl Vito sich auf letzterem nach einem Unfall von einem Freund an der Gitarre vertreten lassen musste, um nur zu singen.<\/p>\r\n<p>Natürlich haben auch J.B.O. wie alle Künstler, die CDs verkaufen, unter der heftigen CD-Rezession zu leiden – an der gleich bleibenden Chartposition kann man erkennen, dass sich das “nur” direkt proportional zum Gesamtmarkt verhält, was die Sache im Endeffekt jedoch nicht besser macht. Wenn sich CDs jedoch immer weniger verkaufen, müssen sich die Kosten einer Produktion in irgendeiner Weise anpassen. Das veranlasste J.B.O. zu dem Entschluss, für die Aufnahme der nächsten CD in der fränkischen Heimat zu bleiben.<br \/> Ab Dezember 2003 bastelten die Vier im rosa Hauptquartier an den Songs, die ab April ’04 eine Tür weiter aufgenommen wurden. Angenehmerweise hatte man sich nämlich mit Produzent Christoph Beyerlein zusammengetan und dessen Studio mit dem Band-Übungsraum unter ein und das selbe Dach gepackt.<\/p>\r\n<p>Im Sommer 2004 gab es dann eine rosane Großoffensive: Anfang August kam das Werk “<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jbo.de\/werke\/united-states-of-bloedsinn\/\">United States of Blöedsinn<\/a>” in die Läden nachdem kurz zuvor am 31.7. das 15-jährige Jubiläum zelebriert wurde – und das an historischem Ort: Wo man im Sommer 1996 zum deutschen Rundumschlag ausholte, kehrte man feiernd zurück – nämlich zum Dechsendorfer Weiher.<br \/> Ab Oktober 2004 gab es die&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jbo.de\/lyrics\/united-states-of-bloedsinn\/\">United States Of Blöedsinn<\/a>-Tour, die gleichzeitig eine mehrfache Jubiläums-Tour war: Einerseits immer noch das 15-Jährige , andererseits spielen J.B.O. auf dieser Tour ihr 500stes Konzert, das mindestens genauso Spaß gemacht hat, wie das erste! Ein Konzert dieser Tour – 2. November 2004 in Mannheim – wurde komplett visuell und akustisch aufgezeichnet, um zu einem Teil der geplanten DVD zu werden.<\/p>\r\n<p>Diese DVD war ein bis dato wohl gehütetes Geheimnis bei J.B.O. – lang hat man sich davor gedrückt, doch die Nachfrage wurde einfach zu groß, weshalb man sich nun doch dafür entschieden hat. Doch bei J.B.O. kann ein solches Unterfangen nicht nur einfach die Konserve eines Live-Konzerts sein, wovon sich die Allgemeinheit ab dem 21. Oktober 2005 selbst überzeugen konnte: Die Ausschnitte aus dem 30\/2-Festival, Wacken 2004 und dem erwähnten Konzert in Mannheim komplettieren nur einen Reigen aus sehr speziellen TV-Parodien, der den Fans auf “TV Blöedsinn” um die Ohren gehauen wird. Dass kurz darauf die erste J.B.O. “Best-Of”-CD erscheint, hat zwar vornehmlich Plattenfirmen-politische Gründe, doch J.B.O. lassen es sich nicht nehmen, die Zusammenstellung der Songs selbst vorzunehmen und eine Neu-Aufnahme des Klassikers “Könige” von der “Expliziten Lyrik” beizusteuern. Übernahmen damals Holmer und Schmitti den Lead-Gesang der ersten und zweiten Strophe, so sind es nun Wolfram und Ralph, die hier ihre selbst verfassten Texte präsentieren – durchaus zur Freude der Fans.<\/p>\r\n<p>Die näxte Veröffentlichung war eine 5-Song-EP namens „Rock Muzik“, die zum Preis einer normalen Single verkauft wurde und die Zeit bis zum näxten Album verkürzen sollte. Dieses, „Head Bang Boing“ betitelt, kam 2007 und war das erste reguläre Album, das auf J.B.O.´s neu gegründetem, eigenen Label „Megapress“ erschien. Seitdem und bis heute sind J.B.O. ihre eigenen Chefs und planen alles selbst, von Tourplanung und Merchandising zum Produzieren und Vermarkten der CDs. Dies in Zusammenarbeit mit Soulfood, einem etabliertem, aber unabhängigen Vertrieb.<\/p>\r\n<p>Obwohl „Head Bang Boing“ in den deutschen Album-Charts nicht so erfolgreich war wie gewohnt, wurden die Konzerte wie immer frenetisch gefeiert. Aber es brauchte wohl nur Zeit, um die Mechanismen von Marketing und Promotion zu lernen, denn das zweite Megapress Album „I don´t like Metal“ (2009) war der nächste Top-10-Erfolg.<\/p>\r\n<p>Aber obwohl diese CD einmal mehr Platz 6 erreichte und die nachfolgenden Tourneen und Festivalauftritte auch für J.B.O.-Verhältnisse sehr erfolgreich verliefen, wurde das 2011 vom „Killeralbum“ noch getoppt, das von 0 auf Platz 3 schoss, der grösste Erfolg der Band im 22. Jahr ihres Bestehens. Nach der gefeierten „Killer Tour“ im Dezember 2011 freut man sich aktuell auf noch viele folgende Shows in vielen Städten und auf Festivals in Deutschland, Österreich, der Schweiz und Luxemburg.<\/p>\r\n<p>Aber auch im nicht deutschsprachigen Raum haben J.B.O. seit 2004 immer wieder komplett englischsprachige Konzerte gespielt, was so gut funktioniert hat, dass man über die Jahre auch einige englische Songs aufgenommen hat. Mit der komplett englischen CD „Happy Metal Thunder“ im Gepäck werden J.B.O. zukünftig also nun nicht nur in Deutschland, sondern auch weltweit die Schwärze des Heavy Metal fröhlich pink erleuchten.<\/p>\r\n<p>Pink ist das neue Schwarz!<\/p>\r\n<p>BLAST!<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/jbo\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5BB49NQAUC8","extraDay":false,"festival":null,"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"jbo_2020.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2020\/jbo_2020.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":24099}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":916,"uri":"https:\/\/www.jbo.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":917,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kickersofass"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":918,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kickersofass\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"6xyJPaGMOPyGyVlqAU2GqE","subtitle":"Special Frühschoppen Show","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/e\/b\/csm_jbo_2020_1c1c2edc69.jpg","uid":333},{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"jbo","pid":176,"title":"J.B.O.","uid":344},"biography":"","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/jbo\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qad7-gpGtWI","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"jbo_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/jbo_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27279}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2105,"uri":"https:\/\/www.jbo.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2106,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kickersofass"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2107,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kickersofass\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2108,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kickersofass"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2109,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/kickersofass"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"6xyJPaGMOPyGyVlqAU2GqE","subtitle":"Special Frühshoppen Show","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/7\/7\/csm_jbo_2023_06ba688921.jpg","uid":731}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"jbo","title":"J.B.O.","uid":344}],"end":"1691146800","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691143200","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"Frühshoppen Show","uid":996},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"caliban","pid":176,"title":"Caliban","uid":565},"biography":"<p>German metalcore juggernaut Caliban are back with their unprecedented thirteenth full-length studio album in a career that’s only approaching the quarter-century mark. The new record, ‘Dystopia’, is every bit as unrelenting and earth-scorching as the heaviest entries in the band’s discography thus far – spanning eleven dynamic tracks of pummeling drums and bass, shredding guitar riffs, and gut-punching gutturals that build into ground-shaking battle cries. Led by founding vocalist Andreas Dörner and lead guitarist Marc Görtz, the band’s newest entry follows the Essen based quintet’s first offering fully performed in their native German tongue (2021’s ‘Zeitgeister’).<br \/> “We had already begun working on ‘Dystopia’, but then changed our plans and decided to complete work on the ‘Zeitgeister’ EP first…then we continued seamlessly with Dystopia. It was quite a change, especially because we had a lot more possibilities in our native language, but since we write mostly in English we were quickly back in the old ‘modus operandi’.”<br \/> Kicking things off with the record’s title track, “Dystopia” opens with a brilliantly gothic arrangement of synth-heavy keys, with Dörner’s blackened vocal bombast delivering the perfect forewarning before dragging deeper into destruction. The band recruited Annisokay frontman Christoph Wieczorek to deliver the soaring vocals on the track’s chorus, contrasting perfectly with the brutality that otherwise encompasses the song on all fronts. “We all like Christoph's voice a lot and I'm a big fan of their latest album, so we thought that he'd be the perfect fit for this song, and I guess we were right.”<br \/> Digging further into the marriage between sinister and unsanctimonious, the eerily haunting guitars licks and hushed passages that open “Ascent Of The Blessed” quickly explode into vicious salvos and bittersweet pleas for survival – all the while boasting the band’s well-honed nuance for implementing digital effects that deliver a more texturally rich and dynamic affair. The following track, “VirUS”, delivers one of the most anthemic, thuddingly brutal and venomous moments on the record – brought to a head by a guest appearance from Marcus Bischoff of Heaven Shall Burn, for whom the band has their fair share of experience collaborating with.<br \/> “We have a long history together with Marcus and Heaven Shall Burn, started making music at the same time and have worked together many times. We decided to follow the same path as my feature on the song “Terminate The Unconcern’ from HSB's last album, ‘Of Truth And Sacrifice’. Our voices complement each other perfectly in this song.”<br \/> Throughout ‘Dystopia’, Caliban sets a standard of delivering punishing instrumental arrangements that flourish into undeniably powerful hooks. Though the results continue to grow stronger with each new record, the band’s methodology for achieving these results haven’t changed – signaling the importance of consistency and conviction in their music. “Our writing process is always: Music\/Instrumental -&gt; Lyrics\/Vocals -&gt; Assembling and Fine Tuning,” adding, “Sometimes the first ideas that come from my gut are best when I hear the riffs.”<br \/> As crucial on the band’s newest studio album as any to date, bassist Marco Schaller and drummer Patrick Grün make every track on ‘Dystopia’ feel like a flurry of body blows that perfectly accentuate Dörner’s heart-wrenching growls. At the very height of this unholy union, songs like “Darkness I Became” and “Dragon” scorch a path of savagery that promises to be new crowd favorites in the pit, wit the latter of the two tracks features a final guest appearance – this one coming from the inimitable Jonny Davy of Job For A Cowboy. “We needed a monster\/’dragon’. Jonny was the perfect choice – his voice on that part of the song is outstanding.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Closing out with absolute rippers like the riff-drenched “Hibernate” and the unnerving monstrosity of “The World Breaks Everyone”, ‘Dystopia’ is a record that holds no punches in its grudges and undaunted dismay. With more than two decades of experience melting faces and empowering fans to face the darkness with unshakable resolve, Caliban display their battle tested strength in these times that more than call for it. Their newest effort might be an acknowledgement of dark times, but let Dystopia prove as a thunderous statement that Caliban will hold strong until the final breath.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/caliban\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FUiWzt1-mCQ","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"caliban_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/caliban_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27276}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2090,"uri":"https:\/\/calibanmetal.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2091,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CalibanOfficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2092,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/calibanofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2093,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/calibanofficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2094,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/calibanofficial"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"1oeo6cC9Fqa2bxxv67qBQL","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/b\/3\/csm_caliban_2023_0933792bab.jpg","uid":728}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"caliban","title":"Caliban","uid":565}],"end":"1691153100","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691149500","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":997},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"leaves-eyes","pid":176,"title":"Leaves' Eyes","uid":628},"biography":"<p>Monumental. Epic. Powerful. – The Vikings’ last battle England in the year 1066. The decisive battle near Stamford Bridge. Warriors fighting death, the grounds soaked in blood.<br \/> Norway’s king Harald III, called Hardrada („the hard ruler“) lies dying. His whole life flashes before his eyes: cruel wars, fights over power, journeys to exotic worlds guiding to powerful women, emperors and kings falling into ruin.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The last Viking King is dead – the Vikings’ age is over. Long live the Vikings.<br \/> “The Last Viking” is the 2020-monumental-piece of LEAVES’ EYES. The setting of the symphonic metal masterpiece couldn’t be more tremendous. With their cult-albums “Vinland Saga” (2005) and “King of Kings” (2015) they already turned Leif Erikssons discovery of America and the life of Norway’s first king into music. Now, LEAVES’ EYES bring the Viking Sagas to their bombastic finale.<\/p>\r\n<p>As always, LEAVES’ EYES attach importance to historical accuracy. History books were devoured, sagas had to be studied. “Some tv dramas or blockbusters make me smirk when I see the Viking Sagas turned upside down. We don’t mess around in mythology!” promises Alexander Krull (vocals), again responsible for conception and lyrics. “The Last Viking” itself would make a great screenplay. The sagas of Hardrada are full of drama, emotions and the everlasting fights for power.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>“The Last Viking” is the epic soundtrack to the mythical world of Viking adventures.<br \/> The raging pagan-hymn “Chain Of The Golden Horn” chronicles Hardrada’s dangerous escape from Byzantium, where a<br \/> heavy iron chain was hidden in the Bosporus waters to wreck hostile ships. The haunting rock opus “Dark Love Empress” tells about the vengeful empress Zoë. When the Viking hero refuses to be one of her many lovers she has him locked in the Byzantine dungeons. The thrilling first single showcases what a key strength the Finnish soprano-sensation Elina Siirala has become to the band sound. In the speedy symphonic-smash hit „Serpents And Dragons“ she joins a strong duet battle with shouter Alex, bringing Hardrada's naval combat for the Danish crown with hundreds of longships impressively to life.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The ten-minute-epic “The Last Viking” is a spectacular ride through the variations of metal music. Being all bombastic, heavy, dark and atmospheric at the same time, it perfectly captures all the drama in Hardrada’s life and death.<\/p>\r\n<p>No doubt: all the musicians exactly know which buttons to push to play out all the strengths of LEAVES’ EYES. The energetic compositions proof the ingenious skills of the song writing duo Thorsten Bauer (guitars) und Alexander Krull (vocals).<\/p>\r\n<p>Straightforward and consequently they follow the line that already has garnered a significant worldwide fan base. Their die-hard followers will be more than pleased with “Break Into The Sky”, acting as a best-of track combining all of the bands’ musical qualities: enthralling song structures, touching melodies and a mystic aura.<\/p>\r\n<p>All the 14 tracks individually impress with their unique build-up, rhythm and atmosphere. Mighty drums, Mediaeval<br \/> instruments like nyckelharpa and fiddle and Celtic horns add spice to the diversified sound. The mystic elegy “Two Kings One Realm” surprises with yet unheard facets. The dark-pop ethno sound wouldn’t be expected from Germany’s symphonic-metal band no. 1. Mastermind Alexander Krull delivers a thrilling, fresh and razor-sharp audio production adding distinctiveness, dynamic and roughness to the sound of LEAVES’ EYES. The new versions of the immediately sold out EP “Night Of The Ravens“, “Serkland“ und “Black Butterfly“ make these tracks an all new adventure. The latter surprises with powerful guest vocals of the French rock sensation Clémentine Delauney &nbsp;Visions of Atlantis, Exit Eden) that terrifically bring the smash-hit to new life.<\/p>\r\n<p>LEAVES’ EYES have always played in a league of their own. They have toured all populated continents, frequently reach top positions in the album charts and with every output they deliver a multimedia masterpiece when it comes to video clips and artwork. With “The Last Viking” they surpass their own standards with the original film documentary “Viking Spirit”. Filmed worldwide, the growing Viking re-enactment scene will be visually praised here. Fronter Alex and the band became part of this community, long ago. With this film, historical facts merge with Nordic mythology, Viking-lifestyle and the sounds of LEAVES’ EYES, featuring friends and companions of the Viking scene. A long awaited complement to their body of work.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Of course, “The Last Viking” won’t be the closure of LEAVES’ EYES – it only fuels expectations what these geniuses will come up next with. With “The Last Viking” Leaves’ Eyes set up their own musical monument that is just as captivating and strong as the saga of the last Viking King itself.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/leaves-eyes\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oDNXBMb9BUM","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"leaves_eyes_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/leaves_eyes_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27539}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2366,"uri":"https:\/\/www.leaveseyes.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2367,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/leaveseyesofficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2368,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/leaveseyesofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2369,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Leaves_Eyes"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2370,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCTZatOEymq3-XKG05NEluKQ"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"63qODcvBCdG2kTguOJkEqJ","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/7\/2\/csm_leaves_eyes_2023_1a7ad5ccf9.jpg","uid":804}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"leaves-eyes","title":"Leaves' Eyes","uid":628}],"end":"1691159400","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691155800","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"Special Viking Show","uid":998},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"takida","pid":176,"title":"Takida","uid":548},"biography":"<p>Robert Pettersson, Tomas Wallin, Mattias Larsson, Chris Rehn and Kristoffer Söderström are the brilliant minds who together form one of the largest bands ever to be conceived in Sweden - Takida.<br \/> Takida formed in 1999. With their first couple of demo recordings things got going organically as they started to spread in their home regions and further to Swedens wildlife region Värmland. Slowly but surely the reputation about the Ånge based group reached the rest of the country. With a record deal secured the debut album “Make You Breathe” was released in 2006, which in short put them in a spot as one of the biggest up and coming rock acts in Sweden.<br \/> They stayed on the road and kept gradually building up a large live audience. In 2007 the quintet got their well-deserved breakthrough with the single “Curly Sue”. The song sold 10 x platinum and broke records by placing 54 weeks on Svensktoppen (Sweden’s biggest radio chart show). Since then, radio successes have been constant with songs such as “Handlake Village”, “The Things We Owe” and “You Learn”, with which Takida has established themselves as one of the most played bands on Swedish radio during the 2000s. Takida have secured no less than five #1 albums on the Swedish chart, becoming one of the best-selling bands in Sweden.<br \/> In 2018, the international career took off when joining forces with BMG. With the singles “Master” and “What About Me?” from the critically acclaimed album “Sju”, came their breakthrough in the German market. “Master” proved to be one of Takida’s greatest radio successes of all time, reaching #1 on Svensktoppen, #122 on German mainstream radio charts and #1 on German rock radio charts, while the album “Sju” reached #29 on German album charts. In 2019, Takida celebrated 20 years as a band and at the beginning of 2020, they embarked on a Nordic anniversary tour just before the COVID-19 breakout.<br \/> In 2021, Takida continues their success in Germany with the new track “Goodbye” that is quickly becoming their biggest radio track so far. The new album “Falling From Fame” was released on the 27th of August and is followed by their biggest Scandinavian and German tour to date.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/takida\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=X4ZK4GnQrr4","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"takida2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/takida2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27195}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2004,"uri":"https:\/\/www.takidamusic.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2005,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/takidamusic"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2006,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/takidamusic\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"3E33tPtYu9wX1t1cp8ELAW","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/3\/9\/csm_takida2023_6181dd4cee.jpg","uid":707}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Schweden","uid":186}],"pathSegment":"takida","title":"Takida","uid":548}],"end":"1691165700","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691162100","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":999},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"donots","pid":176,"title":"Donots","uid":668},"biography":"","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/donots\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N_hp52pIVJ8","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"donots_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/donots_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27887}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2561,"uri":"https:\/\/www.donots.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2562,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/donotsofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2563,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/donotsofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2564,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/donotsofficial"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/a\/3\/csm_donots_2023_05ab30da78.jpg","uid":861}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"donots","title":"Donots","uid":668}],"end":"1691172000","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691168400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1081},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"deicide","pid":176,"title":"Deicide","uid":536},"biography":"<p>After 30 years, it’s plausible to think Florida-based death metallers Deicide would want to slow down and soften the message. None of that is happening, however, on new album Overtures of Blasphemy. In fact, Deicide, with head demon Glen Benton and co-conspirator Steve Asheim at the helm, are only becoming darker, heavier, and more extreme. “I originally thought that the older I got the more mellow I’d get,” says Benton. “That’s not the case. I would say I’m darker now than I ever was. What I’ve been through over the years has definitely darkened my heart and soul.”&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Formed in 1989, Deicide are responsible for shaping death metal at every level. Throughout the ‘90s the group’s tendrils infiltrated, influenced, and inspired hordes fans and musicians, resulting in respect and a rock-solid legacy. Whether it’s 1990’s Deicide, 1992’s Legion, or 1997’s Serpents of the Light, Deicide persisted in their mission to enlighten, inflame, and provoke. That continued through to 2013’s In the Minds of Evil, an album that re-established Deicide as genre leaders. Allmusic said, “In the Minds of Evil features 11 high-quality slabs of muscular, vintage-sounding death metal,” while Lambgoat proclaimed, “The album gives fans what they want, and lets a younger audience know that these veterans are not letting the up-and-comers hog the spotlight.” With Overtures of Blasphemy, Deicide prove yet again quality songwriting, unrelenting heaviness, and a tendentious lyrical message are the focus. “We used a lot of different techniques on Overtures of Blasphemy,” Benton says, “There’s a lot of textures in the songs, some of which we’ve used in the past, but many of them are new to Deicide. The whole concept of writing like this worked out very well. There’s a song on Overtures of Blasphemy that appeals to every type of metal fan.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>What separates Overtures of Blasphemy from its predecessors—going all the way back to Legion—is that Glen Benton returns to the songwriting throne. The last time he wrote a song—“Trifixion”—the world was a very different place. For Deicide’s 12th album, Benton wrote opening track “One with Satan,” “Compliments of Christ,” and “Consumed by Hatred,” while Asheim and guitarists Kevin Quirion and new comer Mark English fleshed out the remaining nine tracks. “When we started the writing process,” says Benton, “I said to the guys, ‘This record doesn’t have to be boring, going-nowhere grind-all-the-time death metal. Let’s really focus on the quality of the songs. I wanted them to write tasty licks and catchy hooks this time. And let the vocals give it its definition.”&nbsp; For the production, Deicide elected to return yet again to Jason Suecof and Audio Hammer Studios in Sanford, Florida. The death metal overlords recorded Overtures of Blasphemy over several months spanning a two-year period. Deicide first laid down the rhythm tracks in 2017. Nine months later the vocals were recorded, as well as the leads. For the mix and master, Deicide once again brought on Alan Douches at West West Side Music. “The studio was pretty laidback,” Benton says. “It’s definitely not a conventional studio experience. There’s no time restraints, there’s no clock to follow, there’s nobody looking over your shoulder. It’s a unique recording experience. Jason is a magician. A master of the craft.”&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Lyrically, Overtures of Blasphemy continues Deicide’s crusade against not just Christianity but all religions. Benton says the lyrics also dig deep into his own personal darkness. In short, there’s no thematic quarter given in tracks like “One with Satan,” “All that is Evil,” “Anointed in Blood,” and “Destined to Blasphemy.” It’s all classic Deicide. “There will always be something to say,” says Benton. “Religion isn’t going away. The record is about the world that I’m in and the world that’s around me.”&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>As for what keeps Deicide’s nefarious engine running all these years, Benton’s inclined to think it’s destiny rather than anything that’s planned out in detail. With the follow-up to Overtures of Blasphemy already in the works, retirement from death metal, at least in the near term, is unlikely. “Some things we’re born into,” Benton says.<\/p>\r\n<p>“It’s what I am. Death metal is what I do.\"&nbsp;<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/deicide\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-l-OiglL460","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"deicide-2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/deicide-2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27094}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1949,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OfficialDeicide"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"2K3GorTixXKAiwe2t9lO89","subtitle":"Special Legion Show","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/7\/a\/csm_deicide-2023_2b12df04c0.jpg","uid":692}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika","uid":220}],"pathSegment":"deicide","title":"Deicide","uid":536}],"end":"1691178300","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691174700","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"Legion Show","uid":1000},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"vv","pid":176,"title":"VV","uid":584},"biography":"<p>In the annals of 21st century alternative rock history there are few artists who cast a longer or more peculiar shadow than Finnish Love Metal pioneer Ville Valo. After all, his band HIM were easily among the most iconic and idiosyncratic groups of the millenium. Zealously revered, gleefully reviled but impossible to ignore, their music left an indelible mark on a worldwide legion of fans. The scarlet letters stood for His Infernal Majesty. Their founder stood for something delightedly out of step with the status quo.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"We only hoped to temporarily redirect hard rock's blood flow from the nether regions towards the heart\", reminisces Ville Valo, the singer, songwriter and primus motor of HIM. Judging by the monolithic presence of the Heartagram in any account of music this side of the millennium it’s apparent that he succeeded.<\/p>\r\n<p>Inspired by everyone from Poe to Bukowski and tinged by a penchant for perfumed Sabbathian gloom, Valo’s creative lovechild would produce eight era-defining studio releases and over ten million record sales, not forgetting a Grammy nomination, countless magazine covers, critical acclaim, and the veneration of a generation. Thus it came as no surprise that the news of a farewell tour in 2017 was greeted with shock and disbelief among devotees and endless speculation as to what or who was to take up the velvet mantle.<\/p>\r\n<p>“As fun as the funeral rites for HIM were, it took me more than a few moons to lick my wounds in the shadow of the Heartagram and come up with an excuse to strum and hum again. Eventually I decided put a leash on my beloved black dog and we started howling together instead of barking at each other. That's how Loveletting was born\".<\/p>\r\n<p>Loveletting, the first single off VV's debut album 'Neon Noir' out in early 2023, suggests this new infernal mix of light and shade is nothing short of a landmark release from one of modern music’s most distinctive and intriguing voices. It belongs to the same forlorn world of woe and whimsy once conceived and governed by Valo in HIM, but with the nuanced notes of a fine aged Cabernet.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"Artistically speaking the main difference between HIM and VV is the extra line in the Heartagram, but what an exquisite line it is! It’s the Mamas and the Papas dressed up as Metallica on their way to a Halloween bash at the Studio 54, and now who wouldn't want to witness that?\"<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/vv\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"ville_vallo_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/ville_vallo_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27394}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2195,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theheartagram\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2196,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/heartagram"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2197,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@heartagram"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"52BS9aeUsHLZJtSW0qe43T","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/c\/4\/csm_ville_vallo_2023_ddcb66128a.jpg","uid":754}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Finnland","uid":67}],"pathSegment":"vv","title":"VV","uid":584}],"end":"1691186400","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691181900","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1001},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"bloodbath","pid":176,"title":"Bloodbath","uid":564},"biography":"<p>Bloodbath formed in 1998 when, one evening, friends Mikael Åkerfeldt (Opeth) - Vocals, Anders Nyström (Katatonia) - Guitars, Jonas Renkse (Katatonia) - Bass, Dan Swanö (Edge Of Sanity) – Drums, thought it would be good to thrash out some classic death metal in the style of early Entombed, mixed with some of the US Florida death metal scene bands. Quite simply, Bloodbath was born out of this shared admiration for quality death metal in the old style &amp; the guys quickly realized that they could churn some ugly metal out to a pretty high standard. From this one session the Breeding Death EP was written; the songs naturally &amp; spontaneously coming together, and subsequently released in 1999.<\/p>\r\n<p>Upon releasing Breeding Death, Bloodbath described their style as \"a tribute to the old-school death metal that reigned in the late '80s and onward.\" The response to the EP's three songs was tremendous. Metal Maniacs hailed it as \"the collective effort of Sweden's most prolific and talented power hitting songsmiths… Finally, a super group has taken the idea of praising the glory years of death metal...and further, this super group has done the right thing by pooling its abundance of talent to form something new instead of falling victim to the stylistic trappings of the retro movement.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>It was two years later that Bloodbath were ready to unleash their debut album upon the world, to be titled Resurrection Through Carnage. Speaking of the material, Mikael Åkerfeldt (who let loose his corrosive throat on the entire album) calls it, \"ten tracks of the purest form of winter like death metal\"; an album of old-school head banging bliss that recalls the glory days of Swedish savagery at the dawn of the '90s.<\/p>\r\n<p>Featuring the same line-up as the EP, the album was greeted with much critical acclaim, quickly establishing Bloodbath as one of Scandinavia’s top death metal acts of the time.<\/p>\r\n<p>And the nightmare continued! Bloodbath - often wrongly referred to as just a retro project or all-star outfit - got fiercely placed back on the metal map with a new album. Very suitably entitled Nightmares Made Flesh (2004), Bloodbath were determined to prove those wrong who thought we were dealing with a short-lived and rather fun-orientated back-to-the-roots unity. Åkerfeldt had recently opted to abandon the band’s ranks due to his busy schedule. After intense research among befriended and likeminded musicians, Bloodbath could proudly announce their new line-up entries of vocalist Peter Tägtgren (Hypocrisy, Pain) and drummer Martin \"Axe\" Axenrot (Opeth, Witchery) behind the kit, as Swanö switched to guitar.&nbsp;&nbsp;This new musical set up added a lot of challenging variety and fresh intensity to Bloodbath's compositions (as well as the long-awaited ability for the band to finally play live shows), as easily witnessed on the 12 tracks featured on Nightmares Made Flesh.<\/p>\r\n<p>Recorded with producer Jens Bogren in Örebro, Sweden at Fascination Street (Katatonia, Opeth, Soilwork, Amon Amarth etc), this striking album gathered the best elements of both the Swedish death metal old school as well as the magic brutality and technical edge of US-Style death metal, highlighted by Tägtgren’s heaviest, most intimidating vocal delivery ever, as well as the very organic, full-on pounding drumming by Axenrot, into an irresistible, breathtaking mixture which left no follower of brutal metal questioning Bloodbath's value and qualities.<\/p>\r\n<p>Bloodbath revealed that their live debut, conducted by a revised cast of musicians, would be held at the 'Wacken Open Air' festival in Germany, August 2005. However, Peter Tägtgren was to back out, due to conflicting schedules, and the band announced Mike Åkerfeldt would make a brief return for the gig, which was a resounding success. One year after the Wacken gig, however, the band decided to part ways with Dan Swanö and replaced him with Per 'Sodomizer' Eriksson (21 Lucifers, Genocrush Ferox).<\/p>\r\n<p>Peaceville Records had become increasingly impressed by the band &amp; a deal was swiftly struck. The first offering was a relentless slab of pure death metal mastery in the shape of the EP Unblessing the Purity in March 2008, released initially to a limited quantity online only. Even with such a low key release, the return of Bloodbath was met with huge acclaim. Unknown to almost everybody - even the band’s label - was the surprise vocalist – the return of Mikael Akerfeldt with his unmistakable &amp; characteristic death-growl lending the music a perfect edge.<\/p>\r\n<p>The previous Wacken show from 2005 had also been filmed as a rare document of the band live &amp; was released on Peaceville Records as a CD\/DVD set in 2008. Entitled The Wacken Carnage, the cover artwork was a pure horror movie inspired masterpiece once more from Travis Smith, perfectly reflecting the coldness &amp; brutality of the band.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> While fans worldwide were chewing on the flesh of Unblessing the Purity &amp; the savagery of The Wacken Carnage, the band had been busy composing for their next full-length album, which was recorded Spring-mid 2008 at Park Studio Stockholm, &amp; then at Ghost Ward studios with David Castillo. Shortly after, Bloodbath made a return to the live setting with a couple of appearances on the festival circuit, at Party.San in Germany &amp; Pellavarock, Finland, showing the band as a true force to be reckoned with in extreme metal circles.<br \/> Retaining the same line-up as the EP, Bloodbath prepared to propel death metal into a whole new darker dimension with The Fathomless Mastery, &amp; a new classic of death metal was born.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Fathomless Mastery saw release in October 2008 &amp; was a huge success for the band; a relentless torrent of brutality giving Bloodbath numerous year-end accolades. Bloodbath continued to play a string of festivals in support of the album &amp; beyond, including a show at the UK's infamous Bloodstock in 2010. This gig was to become the centrepiece of the band’s next release, Bloodbath Over Bloodstock, which showed the act’s relentless live onslaught, as well as offering an insight into the workings of the band with additional interviews, plus extra live footage.<\/p>\r\n<p>Following the release of the DVD, it was reported that vocalist Mikael Akerfeldt had left the band &amp; a replacement was shrouded in mystery, with several rumours and reports on who would step in. Whilst the speculation was spreading, the band entered the studio to create their next masterpiece, with recording commencing in the spring of 2014. It was later revealed that none other than Nick Holmes of UK legends Paradise Lost would be the new vocalist for the album, titled Grand Morbid Funeral.<\/p>\r\n<p>Grand Morbid Funeral was released 17th November 2014. Recorded once again at Ghost Ward Studios and the City of Glass Studios in Stockholm, and mixed by David Castillo, Grand Morbid Funeral, Bloodbath’s fourth full-length studio release, was undoubtedly the band’s darkest and dirtiest opus yet; an organic collection of filth-ridden tracks, remaining steadfast in their old school approach, &amp; rotten to the bone. With eerie doom-like melodies mixed with raw and savage riffing and featuring guest appearances including Chris Reifert and Eric Cutler from US gore-masters Autopsy, Grand Morbid Funeral became a new high-point of brutality for Bloodbath.<\/p>\r\n<p>The band stepped up their live activity in light of the release, playing a multitude of major festivals on both sides of the Atlantic, including Hellfest, Wacken, Party San Open Air, &amp; Maryland Deathfest, though they eventually saw the departure of guitarist Per 'Sodomizer' Eriksson from the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>December 2017 saw Bloodbath joining forces with one of their primary influences, Autopsy, to release a split 7” single and produced a relentless and fitting cover version of Cancer’s ’Blood Bath’ as a dedication to the band responsible for the inspiration behind their own band name.<\/p>\r\n<p>2018, and Bloodbath fans need to prepare for the next chapter. The band began recording their fifth studio album early in the year, at Ghost Ward, City Of Glass &amp; Tri-Lamb Studios, with mixing &amp; mastering handled by Karl Daniel Lidén. Welcomed into the unholy fold is new guitarist, Joakim Karlsson of Swedish black metal cult Craft, The Arrow Of Satan Is Drawn was forged and with an unyielding thirst for the macabre, the band’s current direction takes a step into even darker waters; they explore the boundaries of extremity, mixing in the best of death, thrash &amp; black metal to create a perfect storm of chaos, delivered with the same ferocious HM-2 buzzsaw sound &amp; relentless riff assault mastered over the years, combined with themes of the occult and pure horror.<\/p>\r\n<p>Joining Bloodbath on the ‘Bloodicide’ track is an unholy choir formed from the diabolical triumvirate of UK death metal legends, namely Jeff Walker from Carcass, John Walker from Cancer, and Karl Willetts from Bolt Thrower.<\/p>\r\n<p>The cover was painted by notable artist Eliran Kantor (Testament\/Sodom); a subtle piece to accentuate the title’s underlying looming evil, created as a message of unholy provocation and impending threat.<\/p>\r\n<p>Line-up<\/p>\r\n<p>Nick Holmes – Vocals<br \/> Anders ‘Blakkheim’ Nyström – Guitars<br \/> Jonas Renkse – Bass<br \/> Martin ‘Axe’ Axenrot – Drums<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/bloodbath\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QlDMQZYNoFU","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"bloodbath_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/bloodbath_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27275}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2085,"uri":"https:\/\/www.bloodbath.biz\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2086,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/WackenOpenAir.official"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2087,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/officialbloodbath\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2088,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bloodbathband"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2089,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/bloodbathband"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"7eYmDBinb760MUIfoRdlGQ","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/2\/d\/csm_bloodbath_2023_af0f45e614.jpg","uid":727}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Norwegen","uid":158}],"pathSegment":"bloodbath","title":"Bloodbath","uid":564}],"end":"1691192700","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691189100","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1002},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"focus","pid":176,"title":"Focus","uid":622},"biography":"<p><strong>HEFTIGER PUNKROCK DIREKT AUS DEM HERZEN.<\/strong><br \/> <em><strong>AUS LIEBE ZUR MUSIK.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>IN EINER VON OBERFLÄCHLICHEN TEXTFRAGMENTEN DOMINIERTEN ELEKTRO-WELT VERSUCHT SICH EIN PROVINZIELLE KLEINSTADTBAND MIT WORTGEWALT UND ZIGARETTENQUALM IM DEUTSCHEN PUNKROCK NIEDERZULASSEN.<\/p>\r\n<p>DAS ZIEL: KORNKREIS ÄHNLICHE MOSHPITS, WELTVERÄNDERNDE SOLI, RAUSCH, EXZESS, DAS LOSSAGEN VOM BEKANNTEN – KURZ, EIN ALBUM, DAS KEINER HAT KOMMEN SEHEN: FOCUS.

As for<br \/> any prolific punk rock ensemble you would think this meant sure death, drowning<br \/> themselves in self-pity, diaper changes, heteronormative male-insecurity due to changing<br \/> gender roles, mortgage, marriage and heavy bodily decay. While most of these are still true,<br \/> the pitch black satiric humor that has characterized GBZ throughout their career seems only<br \/> to be fueled further on by the growing bitterness instilled in these five hemorrhoid infested<br \/> critters. The songs are getting faster, the riffs raunchier, the vocals more desperate, and<br \/> their song titles - for which GBZ have always been acclaimed - more poignantly ridiculous.<br \/> The band started out with a bunch of now out-of-print 7“s before the release of their debut<br \/> album «Anti-World Music» in 2013, «Hadeland Hardcore» in 2015 and «Misanthropical<br \/> House» in 2018. The latter got the band a Norwegian Grammy for best rock album in 2018.<br \/> In 2020 they followed up with «Algorithm &amp; Blues», before unleashing «Research and<br \/> Destroy», arguably their best album to date, in 2022.<br \/> No longer only a relic of the 90’s Oslo scene, GBZ have crafted their own branch on the<br \/> Scandirock tree of heritage, one that has vastly grown due to a dedicated following that only<br \/> seems to multiply with every album release. This can only mean that GBZ is filling a void in<br \/> the hearts of many a depraved deviant, scratching that itch one cannot reach neither by<br \/> compulsive masturbation nor abusive online behavior. There is once again a purpose to GBZ<br \/> - there is still much more to be said.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/the-good-the-bad-and-the-zugly\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1dHvfyFKzOQ","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"the_good_the_Bad_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/the_good_the_Bad_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27553}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2423,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/goodbadzugly\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2424,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/goodbadzug\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2425,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Goodbadzug"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2426,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCrDVrKjcujcLnc5tjp70wOQ"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"3YQf0KGXHQ5dSaSPPmUGxT","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/3\/0\/csm_the_good_the_Bad_2023_8becadf81b.jpg","uid":818}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Norwegen","uid":158}],"pathSegment":"the-good-the-bad-and-the-zugly","title":"The Good the Bad and the Zugly","uid":638}],"end":"1691153100","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1408","subtitle":"","title":"Headbangers Stage","uid":7},"start":"1691150400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1009},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"depressive-age","pid":176,"title":"Depressive Age","uid":540},"biography":"<p>\"Angesichts solcher Überzeugungskraft ist es gewiss nicht zu hoch gegriffen, hier von Psycho-Metal in Perfektion zu sprechen.

It aligns on new paradigms: baring its teeth while keeping a sense for catchy melodies.<br \/> &nbsp;<br \/> GHØSTKID is the new namesake of Sebastian “Sushi“ Biesler (formerly Eskimo Callboy) and a conspiracy of friends and likeminded allies who have come to a riot of their own: Steve Joakim (drums) from Sweden as well as Jan Marco Heinz (guitar) Chris Kisseler (guitar) and Stanislaw Czywil (bass).<br \/> &nbsp;<br \/> The new noise commenced in October 2019 when Sushi picked up a guitar and started writing for GHOSTKID. GHØSTKID wasn’t merely an outlet - it was in his DNA. “I just followed my heart”, he says. At that point Sushi was inspired by a steady diet of Marilyn Manson, Fever 333 and Bring Me the Horizon, all of whom inspired him to meld together sundry sonic shades, touching on pop, metal, industrial and a hint of trap. It was the foundation for the shape of rock to come. No mean feat for the Sushi, who initially started out as a guitarist, but when the original singer of one of his previous bands dropped out during a recording session Sushi simply picked up the mike. “I love both roles”, he says. “Actually, whenever I am playing guitar I miss singing, but I also miss a guitar in my hands when I am just singing.”<br \/> &nbsp;<br \/> Cut to the fall of 2019. It was time to really start from scratch, to tear it up and start over again. Christoph Wieczorek (Annisokay) and co-producer Phil Sunday joined up to start rewiring Sushi’s sonic interface which would begin spitting out GHOSTKID’s anthemic data-flow. Finally, renowned producer Sky van Hoff (Rammstein, Emigrate) came aboard to hammer into shape what would become GHOSTKID’s self-titled Century Media debut.<br \/> &nbsp;<br \/> Sushi delivered on GHOSTKID’s album with a laser-focused vision. And a lot proverbial blood on the tracks. “I am looking back to a very intense time when I learned a lot about myself”, he explains. Joining the aural fracas are Marcus Bischoff of Century Media labelmates Heaven Shall Burn on “SUPERNØVA” and the legendary genre-smasher Mille Petrozza on “CRØWN”. Upcoming are two versions of “THIS IS NØT HØLLYWØØD” – one with Timi Hendrix from Trailerpark and one with Johnny 3 Tears from Hollywood Undead on vocals.<br \/> &nbsp;<br \/> Once you immerse yourself in the layers of noise and ambition, it’s really no surprise that Sushi has successfully morphed into the entity known as GHØSTKID. “It leaves a lot of room for interpretations while you immediately associate certain imagery with it,” he says. Warning: this is music that doesn’t merely haunt your sensibilities. It’s a full-blown aural exorcism and a deafening harmony in your head.&nbsp;<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/ghostkid\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JQeqBbSXfm0","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"ghostkid2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/ghostkid2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27192}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1992,"uri":"https:\/\/www.ghost-kid.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1993,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ghostkidofficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":1994,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/ghostkiddo\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":1995,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/iamghostkid"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":1996,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCsp-_mUeq7S87lZXZe_kTWQ"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"2ooWmQC4NQUQZ3z00mZQyK","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/a\/1\/csm_ghostkid2023_54f04a79cd.jpg","uid":704}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"ghostkid","title":"Ghostkid","uid":545}],"end":"1691167500","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1408","subtitle":"","title":"Headbangers Stage","uid":7},"start":"1691164800","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1011},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"dog-eat-dog","pid":176,"title":"Dog Eat Dog","uid":572},"biography":"","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/dog-eat-dog\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=c_FAGSiyiR4","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"dog_eat_dog_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/dog_eat_dog_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27376}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2134,"uri":"https:\/\/www.dogeatdogofficial.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2135,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dogeatdog.official\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2136,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dogeatdog.official\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"3K6gIioKTRy1TWaoJlHMgx","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/b\/b\/csm_dog_eat_dog_2023_f298969989.jpg","uid":738}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika","uid":220}],"pathSegment":"dog-eat-dog","title":"Dog Eat Dog","uid":572}],"end":"1691175600","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1408","subtitle":"","title":"Headbangers Stage","uid":7},"start":"1691172000","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1012},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"legion-of-the-damned","pid":176,"title":"Legion Of The Damned","uid":91},"biography":"<p>Dutch extreme Thrash-metal outfit Legion of the Damned arose in the early years of the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century and quickly made name for themselves.

DYING<br \/> FETUS also represented death metal as a genre on a panel at the convention.<br \/> In 1996, DYING FETUS ‘ second album, Purification Through Violence was released<br \/> simultaneously in America on Pulverized Records and in Europe on Diehard Music Worldwide.<br \/> The band immediately embarked on their first full North American tour, hitting 25 cities with<br \/> Canada’s KATAKLYSM and Florida’s MONSTROSITY. The response to the band’s unreal live<br \/> show was astounding and the DYING FETUS name began to take residence in the minds of<br \/> metal heads everywhere.<br \/> 1998 saw the release of DYING FETUS ‘ third album, Killing on Adrenaline on both Germany’s<br \/> Morbid Records and in the U.S. through the band’s own label, Blunt Force Records. DYING<br \/> FETUS embarked on unprecedented 52-date North American\/European tour, hitting 12<br \/> countries in the process- from Denmark to Spain and Belgium to Poland. The band performed at<br \/> dozens of festivals, including co-headlining shows on the Morbid Metalfest, as well as the<br \/> Superbowl of Hardcore. During this time, DYING FETUS continued to make a name for<br \/> themselves, appearing in national and international magazines, placing tracks on dozens of<br \/> compilation CDs, and consistently doing radio and internet promotional activities. All on their<br \/> own accord.<br \/> In 1999, DYING FETUS reissued the out of print ‘Infatuation with Malevolence’ CD (their 93-94<br \/> demo collection) with extra tracks via their own label, Blunt Force Records. The new version<br \/> contained three live songs recorded on the 1998 European tour, as well as one demo track not<br \/> included on the previous edition of the disc.<br \/> Looking to expand their scope even further, DYING FETUS signed to Relapse Records in early<br \/> 2000 and immediately hit the road for a U.S. tour with DESTRUCTION and KATAKLYSM. The<br \/> band re-issued their Grotesque Impalement EP, a collection of old material and covers before<br \/> completing work on their first Relapse album ‘Destroy The Opposition’. A musical mugging<br \/> aimed at corporate “rock,” ‘Destroy The Opposition’ was a brutal response to the everyday<br \/> stress and pressures of reality in today’s age, providing a natural outlet for the alienation and<br \/> frustration that such a pathetically consumer-oriented and greed-dominated society creates. The<br \/> record was an immediate success and the band hit the road, touring internationally in support of<br \/> the album for the next 16 months. In 2012, the album went on to receive Decibel Magazine’s<br \/> prestigious Hall of Fame honor.<br \/> After almost three years DYING FETUS returned with Stop At Nothing in 2003. Symbolically<br \/> representative of the greater alliance of anti-mainstream death metal\/grindcore\/hardcore-punk<br \/> scenes, DYING FETUS stand in direct opposition to what is considered “normal” in the<br \/> overwhelmingly conformist American musical arena. The band quickly hit the road in support of<br \/> Stop At Nothing completing numerous North American and European headlining tours as well<br \/> as delivering stand-out performances at international metal festivals.<br \/> Since then, DYING FETUS has been on a path toward supremacy, destroying everything in<br \/> their path while attracting more loyal followers with every step. 2007 saw the release of War of<br \/> Attrition, which found the band touring with CANNIBAL CORPSE and label-mates<br \/> NECROPHAGIST . This release was followed by Descend Into Depravity, the 2009 masterpiece<br \/> which led to numerous headlining tours in North America and abroad, including the band’s first<br \/> ever appearances in China and Southeast Asia.<br \/> On June 19th 2012, DYING FETUS took their biggest leap yet, with their earth-shattering album<br \/> Reign Supreme. Long-term fans rejoiced at the band’s consistency and critics lauded the band’s<br \/> unparalleled musicianship, with Heavymetal.about.com raving that “Dying Fetus are at the top of<br \/> their game with this record, which is sure to thrill old fans and gain them even more new ones.”<br \/> With Reign Supreme, arguably their heaviest release yet, it is clear why the band has been<br \/> hailed as “one of the most dominating forces in death metal,” and why they were booked to play<br \/> the UK’s infamous Download Festival almost purely on a fan campaign via Facebook and<br \/> Twitter. Anything less than total supremacy is simply not an option for this band.<br \/> Now in 2017, DYING FETUS once again raise the bar of sonic extremity with their 8th studio<br \/> album and first new material in over 5 years, Wrong One To Fuck With . The seasoned veterans<br \/> manage to further stretch their creative and technical boundaries across 10 complex tracks of<br \/> pulverizing death metal, filled with more dynamic intricacies, brutal breakdowns and varied vocal<br \/> patterns than ever before.

With Germany’s leading gothic metal act, it’s drummer Markus J llich in collaboration with the producer of each individual album that’s kept the group’s compositions on course for more than 25 years. At the same time, Markus J llich has enough experience to know that the band’s evolvement depends on fresh ideas and new influences.<\/p>\r\n<p>So, by enlisting guitarists Tosse Basler and Rolf Munkes and, soon after, bassist Jason Mathias he has ensured that the band has remained contemporary and diverse ever since their 2016 release Monument, reaping the fruits his efforts on the new album Oblivion. “In particular, the sound and the selection of songs reflect the impact our three new band members have had,” comments Markus J llich. “Tosse is a fantastic rhythm guitarist who adds even more diversity to the material with his clean vocals, and our lead guitarist Rolf enhances the record with his solos. Jason has added lots of drive to the deep frequencies, which is why we’ve consciously opted for a loud mix of the bass parts.” Along with his wife Katrin (keyboards &amp; samples) and vocalist Felix Stass, the three new additions are important factors that ensure that Crematory find themselves in a contemporary and forward-looking position in 2018.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Crematory have rarely sounded as multi-faceted and timeless as on Oblivion. The group’s classic trademarks, such as Felix Stass’s deep growls, are still present, at the same time new influences emphasise their great commercial potential. Markus J llich: “So far we’ve had a special motto to set the direction of each of our albums, but Oblivion simply combines all our strengths and experience. Over the years we’ve learned to blend different styles into the typical Crematory sound without ever losing sight of the importance of playing in a way that benefits our music. The motto “less is more” applies to our compositions 100 per cent. Crematory songs never lose themselves in exaggerated effects but always go the whole hog. That’s partly due to the fact that we’ve remained very much down-to-earth.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Which is exactly what Crematory’s countless fans will be able to witness when the band embark on their 15-show tour of Germany at the end of April 2018. As Markus J llich aptly puts it: “Even if we know exactly what matters when you tour, we want to learn something new with every new concert.”<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/crematory\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HkqiYeETP3I","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":false,"title":"WOA 2019","uid":1},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"crematory-artist-2019.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2019\/crematory-artist-2019.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":22755}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":144,"uri":"http:\/\/www.crematory.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":145,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CREMATORY"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":146,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Crematory_Band"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":147,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/CrematoryDe"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"4q2uhIfBHCNlwXYvQdnzvS","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/a\/c\/csm_crematory-artist-2019_1a7ce6bf51.jpg","uid":41},{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"crematory","pid":176,"title":"Crematory","uid":40},"biography":"<p>Gothic Metal legends CREMATORY, who made a smashing impact on the German charts position #17 with their latest album, Inglorious Darkness, once again grace the music scene with another single from the album.

In general, HARPYIE music is stylistically deeply rooted in the folk-metal direction, whereby each composition reaches out to different genres. Therefore, strongly orchestrated elements from classic and folk, as well as modern electronic sounds find their application aside the usual metal-basis. The quintet around lead singer Aello does not only impress with the contrast between playful touches of aesthetics and a brutal force, but rather above all with the synthesis of these arts, where the stories from the songs wind through the total artwork forming a key theme for the album. HARPYIE´s consistent German lyrics deal with striking themes from history and mythology, over significant world affairs, up to the topics that surround the various traits of human beings in all its aspects. Within every published album, HARPYIE creates an own separate world to come alive, to give a face and words, or even with the intent to destroy the established world again in the end.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/harpyie\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aGewiiR1Ejk","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":false,"title":"WOA 2019","uid":1},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"harpyie-2019.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2019\/harpyie-2019.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":22962}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":321,"uri":"https:\/\/www.harpyien.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":322,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/harpyien"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":323,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/harpyieofficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":324,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/harpyieband\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"6Z48DAdZXTdQ65IiDAyKRC","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/9\/9\/csm_harpyie-2019_968e02d86c.jpg","uid":90},{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"harpyie","pid":176,"title":"Harpyie","uid":89},"biography":"<p>Willkommen in der Freakshow!<\/p>\r\n<p>Harpyie – eine Folkmetalband, so archaisch und wortgewandt wie ihr griechischer Name prophezeit, der übersetzt „die Reisser“ bedeutet.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mit Wurzeln im ostwestfälischen Bad Oeynhausen verstehen sich die Metalcorefolker als Kulturhybrid mit Zeitgeist, in deren Brust zwei Herzen, moderner Metal und Folk im gleichen Takt schlagen.<\/p>\r\n<p>Harpyie sind mittlerweile viel mehr als nur noch ein Geheimtipp.<\/p>\r\n<p>So können sie sich mit 8 Alben in ihrer 11-jährigen Bandgeschichte schmücken, und sind neben Auftritten auf den angesagtesten Metalfestivals, wie dem Wacken Open Air und dem Summerbreeze, auch aus den offiziellen deutschen Albumcharts nicht mehr wegzudenken.

Jedoch wären&nbsp;<strong>TANZWUT<\/strong>&nbsp;nicht diese unverwechselbare Band, die sie nun mal sind, wenn sie sich ein einziges Thema herauspicken und dieses als Album veröffentlichen würden. Bei dieser Interpretation geht es um mehr, viel mehr. Denn die große Frage, die dieses Album stellt ist, wer würde seine Seele verkaufen oder noch drastischer gesagt, wer hat seine Seele bereits verkauft und wir ahnen es nicht?<br \/> <br \/> Das Besondere an diesem Album ist, dass Mastermind Teufel insgesamt 14 Titel (+ Bonustrack) mit seiner Band produziert hat, die sowohl als einzelne Songs für sich stehen können, aber sich ebenfalls wie ein roter Faden durch das Werk ziehen. Mit „Schreib es mit Blut“ wird ein neues Kapitel in der Historie um&nbsp;<strong>TANZWUT<\/strong>veröffentlicht. Hier verschwimmen die Grenzen zwischen Poesie und Mittelalter-Rock. Hier wird klar, dass&nbsp;<strong>TANZWUT<\/strong>&nbsp;dieses Album mit Herzblut unterschrieben haben. Gut durchdachte Lyrics und eine beeindruckende Produktion unterstreichen die Ausnahmestellung dieser Band. Niemand traut sich derart viele ungewöhnliche klangliche Experimente zu, wie eben Teufel und seine Mitmusiker.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ein besonderes Highlight dürfte die Powerballade „Stille Wasser“ werden, die gemeinsam mit der Ex-„Leaves‘ Eyes“- Sängerin Liv Kristine produziert wurde und als Bonustrack auf dem Digipak zu finden sein wird. Der Titeltrack und zeitgleich die erste Single wird auf den Namen „Schreib es mit Blut“ hören und die Fans bereits vor Veröffentlichung des Albums neugierig auf den neuen Sound von&nbsp;<strong>TANZWUT<\/strong>machen. Krachende Gitarren und überraschende Breaks erschaffen hier eine Partyhymne wie aus dem Bilderbuch. Mit diesem Beitrag hat man einen zeitlosen Klassiker erschaffen, der zweifelsohne zu einem Referenzwerk heranreifen wird und viele weitere Bands inspirieren dürfte. Ein weiterer Höhepunkt ist der ungewöhnliche Song „Reiter ohne Kopf“. Eine große Stärke dieser Band ist es doch schließlich, Geschichten zu erzählen und auch alte Schätze aus dem Mittelalter neu zu entdecken, so entstand die Sage vom Reiter ohne Kopf der Rache übt. Zu diesem Track wird es das erste&nbsp;<strong>TANZWUT<\/strong>-Comic geben, das nicht nur bei eingefleischten Fans für Überraschungen sorgen dürfte. Mit „Chaos“ betreten die Spielleute Neuland. Hier zeigt sich die gesamte Bandbreite der Herren. Vielfältige Instrumente, ein Dudelsack-Duell, leichte Industrial-Anleihen und ein schneller, getriebener Gesang zeichnen diese Nummer besonders aus. Dem geneigten Zuhörer stellt sich nur die Frage, ob es sich hierbei um eine apokalyptische Vorsehung handelt oder doch eher um unseren Alltag, den wir bereits leben? Mit „Reich sein“ steht einer der unbeschwertesten&nbsp;<strong>TANZWUT<\/strong>&nbsp;Songs aller Zeiten in den Startlöchern. Ein Guter-Laune-Song, der sich sowohl als Live-Stück anbietet, als auch die Frage stellt, ob den Menschen Freiheit oder Reichtum wichtiger sind?<br \/> <br \/> Wer in den Sommermonaten mit dem Fernweh zu kämpfen hat und bisher noch kein Reiseziel für sich entdecken konnte, dem sei „An den Klippen“ ans Herz gelegt. Hier trifft irische Sehnsucht auf mittelalterliche Klänge und erzählt eine dramatische Liebesgeschichte, wie man sie wohl nur auf der grünen Insel findet. Verträumt und trotzdem real, eine Mixtur, die die Menschen schon immer faszinierte. Im Hause&nbsp;<strong>TANZWUT<\/strong>&nbsp;leugnet man seine Wurzeln nicht, trotz Weiterentwicklung und Besetzungswechsel und so findet sich mit „Wer weiß“ eine traditionelle Spielmannsnummer auf diesem Album, die sowohl neuen als auch alten Fans gefallen dürfte. Die Härte des Tracks steigert sich kontinuierlich und spätestens beim Refrain muss man einfach mitsingen.<br \/> <br \/> Ein besonderes Augenmerk liegt auf der limitierten Fan-Box, hier findet man vielseitige und außergewöhnliche Beiträge, die neben einem Comic zu dem Song „Reiter ohne Kopf“ auch eine Feder und ein Fässchen mit Blut samt des dazugehörigen Kontrakts mit dem Teufel enthalten wird. Für Freunde der etwas härteren Klänge haben sich Teufel und Herrmann Ostfront zusammengeschlossen und präsentieren „Bruder Leichtsinn“. Ein Song, der vor Härte und Tempi-Wechsel nur so strotzt und beide Fanlager vereinen wird. Die Gothic-Rocker von „Project Pitchfork“ und die Szene-Urgesteine on „DIE KRUPPS“ steuern jeweils ihre ganz eigenen Interpretationen von Tanzwut-Songs in Form von einem Remix bei. Hier stellen&nbsp;<strong>TANZWUT<\/strong>&nbsp;einmal mehr unter Beweis, dass man Neuerungen nicht fürchtet, sondern gezielt für die Weiterentwicklung der Band einsetzt, ohne dabei seine Wurzeln zu vergessen. Zwei Videoclips werden nicht nur die Herzen der eingefleischten Fans im Sturm erobern, sondern auch außerhalb der Szene für Aufsehen sorgen. Es ist also wieder an der Zeit durchzudrehen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> <strong>TANZWUT<\/strong>&nbsp;sind wieder da. Härter, facettenreicher und überraschender als jemals zuvor. Neue Ideen und die bewährte Tradition erschaffen ein Elixier, dem man sich nicht entziehen kann. Da bleibt nur zu hoffen, dass dieser Kelch nicht an euch vorbeigeht.&nbsp; Seid auch ihr bereit, eure Seele für dieses Album zu verkaufen?<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/tanzwut\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TNABHax-Qt0","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":false,"title":"WOA 2019","uid":1},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"tanzwut_2019.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2019\/tanzwut_2019.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":23264}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":511,"uri":"https:\/\/www.tanzwut.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":512,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TANZWUTOfficial\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"1lnAE48Ht3fnUDrcnx2nTM","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/3\/7\/csm_tanzwut_2019_c6a524c1d6.jpg","uid":156},{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"tanzwut","pid":176,"title":"Tanzwut","uid":155},"biography":"<p>The creation of a legend - the medieval pioneers of \"Tanzwut\"<br \/> It came at a dark time in Germany when the plague wiped out entire regions. To escape this misery, people danced ecstatically until they collapsed from exhaustion or died. At the time, this condition was called “Tanzwut“ (choreomania). Nowadays this term stands for the most versatile and imaginative music group in the medieval scene. No other band has so far managed to combine modernity and history as well as frontman Teufel and his men. But how did the story of these venerable minstrels begin?<br \/> As is the case with good stories, the exact backgrounds are nebulous and kept in shadow. But it is absolutely certain that a certain Teufel and a well-known Micha, also called “Das letzte Einhorn”, met each other in Berlin. Apparently the chemistry between these two advocates of the dark age was so similar that it was decided to revive the art of the minstrel in the medieval fairs and on the streets. The performance was fundamentally different from everything that people had ever see before. The music came from strange instruments, from bagpipes and all sorts of other strange bits and pieces. However, not only the music was in the foreground. Teufel and Micha even managed to become famous with puppet shows for young and old. The name of this band, which can certainly be seen as the starting signal for an entire sub-genre, was “Pullarius Furcillo”. So they wandered around the country together for several years and shared everything before they decided to go their own way. Teufel tried himself and founded Tanzwut at the end of the 90s.<br \/> In 1999 the time had finally come when the first CD “Tanzwut” was released with Teufel being the lead singer. A band that was able to combine medieval sounds as well as modern tones. The first album \"Tanzwut\" caught a lot of attention. Should you like it not? Most of the press, quite rightly, chose the first option. Tanzwut gave the medieval rock its very own facet.<br \/> Exactly this exceptional status brought the band a major label deal and they created the second studio CD - Teufel always had and still has enough ideas. The band's public acceptance increased significantly with the second album, “Labyrinth der Sinne”. On that CD you will find songs like “Der Wächter” or “Lügner”, which are indispensable today. Also included is the cover version of “Bitte, Bitte” from “Die Ärzte”, which every time leads to a fit of cheers at the band's concerts. With the unusual piece “Freude schöner Götterfunken” Tanzwut unite the text of Goethe's “Faust” with the sounds of Beethoven's “9. Symphony ”, a masterpiece that has never been achieved in the black scene.<br \/> Meanwhile the concerts of “Tanzwut” were no longer considered an insider tip. The halls were full and the fans were thrilled. This inevitably led to the creation of the CD “Ihr wolltet Spaß”, which was released in 2003. The title track is still considered to be groundbreaking when it comes to modern medieval music. this album features the anthem of all Tanzwut fans \"Meer\". Then and still today generations are thrilled to honor their minstrels on every tour. In this context, it is also very positive that all age groups are present at a Tanzwut concert. You feel like a big family.<br \/> After a three-year break, the most controversial Tanzwut album “Schattenreiter” came out. With significantly more electronical touch, the minstrels did not hit every taste, but remained true to themselves and with “Immer noch wach” they had a cooperation with the medieval band “Schandmaul” on their new double CD that was worth listening to. With a little distance, many critics of that time would certainly like to revise their judgment, because whether it is \"Vulkan\", \"Wieder am Riff\" or \"Toccata\" - the hit density of this masterpiece will last forever.<br \/> Disputes and rifts arise even in the most harmonious bands. Since they did not want to do such conditions to their loyal fans, \"Tanzwut\" took a break. But nothing is forever and so Teufel started again with a new line-up in 2010. After some acclaimed live performances, it was clear to the men that they should go to the studio to finally be able to offer the thirsty fan base new material. The<br \/> purely medieval album “Morus et Diabolus” was released, a journey back to the beginnings of the band. However, the second heart, which beats in Teufel's chest, announced: They wanted to put more rock and more electro in their releases - it was supposed to be cracking, like back then.<br \/> In 2011 the time had finally come and “Weiße Nächte” was on the shelves. An album that can be seen as a completely new beginning. A music video was dedicated to the title track, which has since enjoyed great popularity on YouTube. The subsequent tour (including the Subway to Sally's legendary “Eisheilige Nächte”) can be seen as an absolute success, where not only old fans shohwd up. Tanzwut had managed the feat to inspire the next generation with their music. So you can see: whoever thinks that medieval rock is over has not counted on Tanzwut.<br \/> After an extensive tour and a few appearances at summer festivals, the minstrels got lots of compliments and deference. Nobody expected such a return. Since they had experienced a lot in the last two years and also (re)-discovered new influences, almost naturally ideas came for new lyrics. The logical consequence was the new rock CD “Höllenfahrt”, which took the hearts of fans by storm in 2013 . On this disc there are remixes of Tanzwut songs, e.g. Chris Pohl (Blutengel). The video clip “Das Gerücht” achieved again high click rates on YouTube. A special feature of the video was that the band invited their fans to become part of this work themselves and so a grandiose adventure was captured on film in the former silent movie theater “Delphi” in Berlin. However, the album had other top-class products to offer and so it was decided to dedicate a video to the song \"Der Himmel brennt\" (Heaven burns). Impressively and very artistically implemented, the video was once again able to garner the sympathy of the fans. In addition to the successful title track, all songs were convincing, in particular the song \"Schwarzer Engel\" is already considered the hymn of all dark romanticists.<br \/> Restless, as we know Teufel, in 2014 the medieval “Eselsmesse” was celebrated on a separate album. Elaborate videos for \"Unsere Nacht\", which was implemented with the support of Jule Bauer, and \"Eselskönig\", in which the group \"Entr’Act\" appeared, were produced. The videos were shot in Kaltenberg with with real royal support of Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, as well as Princess Beatrix of Bavaria and Prince Heinrich of Bavaria. The enthusiasm of the fans was only too easy to understand, as both clips are considered reference works in the medieval scene.<br \/> The turn of the year was just around the corner and Tanzwut continued to write their own story. With “Freitag der 13.” they walked on new ways. The album became a true fan favorite and is still considered the most successful Tanzwut album of all time. A reference work was created with illustrious guests such as Chris from “Blutengel” or Martin Engler from “Mono Inc.”. The song “Brüder im Geiste” took the hearts of the fans by storm and made it onto the live set list of “Tanzwut”.<br \/> Since Teufel and his men are seen as restless minstrels, the next studio CD was already in the starting blocks. “Schreib es mit Blut” created a storyline that ran like a red thread through all tracks, but is not a concept album. With this title, “Tanzwut” has achieved something that is certainly not commonplace. So everyone has a spontaneous association with the topic \"Schreib es mit Blut\". Be it the legendary signature of Goethe's Faust or the temptation that comes from a simple signature and opens up possibilities that previously could only be dreamed of. Inevitably you have to think about how high the price would be to sell your soul yourself or who has even already done it? Each song has its own message, but can also be viewed collectively and opens up new perspectives. The title track \"Schreib es mit Blut\" makes fans' hearts beat faster, a timeless \"Tanzwut\" classic that has found its place in the band's history.<br \/> With “Seemannsgarn”, Tanzwut 2019 went one step further. The band focused again more on classic minstrel music paired with solid rock and metal influences and largely dispensed with elements of electronic music. The fantastic stories between truth and illusion pull the audience under their spell<br \/> as if by magic and the devil's captivating voice does its part. In addition to mystical hymns, the band does not shy away from addressing unpleasant topics in their songs, as always, and thus they have once again outdone themselves with “Seemannsgarn” and manifested their status as THE medieval rockers.<br \/> The following year 2020, in addition to all the difficulties that it brought with it, represented another milestone in the history of Tanzwut. In the summer the minstrels announced their collaboration with the indie label NoCut Entertainment. In the course of this great collaboration, the tenth studio album in Tanzwut's career was announced with a meaningful name for the end of May 2021: „Die Tanzwut kehrt zurück“.<br \/> The name of the groundbreaking new album by the Berlin medieval rock legends says it all. The opener and title track “Die Tanzwut kehrt zurück” lashes like an unstoppable storm and then breaks down on the listener with full musical fury. What a start! Thematically Tanzwut go straight to the limit on the track and deliver a message that is worth thinking about. The song tells of the black death, also known as the plague, going around. So what's the point of accumulating material goods? Tanzwut advise instead to just enjoy the moment and live life as if there was no tomorrow. But also socially critical topics address Tanzwut on the upcoming album. “Feine Menschen” is about the fact that many people only think of themselves and their own benefit and literally walk over corpses.<br \/> A special highlight certainly is the song “Pack schlägt sich” feat. Saltatio Mortis. A true hymn to life, friendship and solidarity, which will quickly become THE new fan favorite in concerts. Tanzwut also prove that they not only master loud tones, but also soft and delicate sounds. They succeed in doing this perfectly in the song “Allein”, the text of which describes the longing for a lost love and the pursuit of happiness.<br \/> With “Die Tanzwut kehrt zurück” Tanzwut convince through musical diversity and texts that touch, tell stories and critically illuminate current affairs. Thus they make sure without a doubt that they belong to the top of medieval rock acts.<br \/> The only final word that remains is Teufel's creed: “Let's go crazy!” We’re having Tanzwut.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/tanzwut\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qZN_F-0neOg","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"tanzwut_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/tanzwut_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27551}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2413,"uri":"https:\/\/tanzwut.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2414,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TANZWUTOfficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2415,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tanzwut_official\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2416,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TANZWUTofficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2417,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCajYOraHQ2SOnDhctCCZRJw"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"1lnAE48Ht3fnUDrcnx2nTM","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/3\/5\/csm_tanzwut_2023_76b204414d.jpg","uid":816}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"tanzwut","title":"Tanzwut","uid":155}],"end":"1691183700","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2304","subtitle":"","title":"Wackinger Stage","uid":10},"start":"1691180100","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1020},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"autumn-bride","pid":176,"title":"Autumn Bride","uid":612},"biography":"<p>Autumn.

I sang the melody with the lyrics and instinctively the boys started playing as if the song was always there, within us. I had goosebumps and tears rushed into my eyes.” says Leadsinger Suzy, who had performed with an IRON MAIDEN Tribute Band, while the rest of the band were raising the roof with their Thrash and Death Combos.<br \/> <br \/> United they implemented their very own version of Symphonic Metal, influenced by Icons like PARADISE LOST, NIGHTWISH, BLACK SABBATH, EVANESCENCE, TYPE O NEGATIVE and THE GATHERING: hard riffs, catching melodies, highly musical emotion, grand vocals and great lyrics: an intensive combination of all called AUTUMN BRIDE.<br \/> <br \/> UNDYING. The title refers to the mystic character which was the namesake from the “Fear and Devotion” Video, “who embodies death but at the same time eternal life as well. A celestial full of fear, dedication and love. The essential topic of all AUTUMN BRIDE Songs” explains Suzy about the lyrical concept.<br \/> <br \/> Latter the band will succeed playfully with “Undying”: melancholic and anthemic, great melodies, catchy refrains, thrilling Guitarriffs, impulsive yet soulful rhythms and carefully used synths. The vocals get right under your skin, the music right into your ear, heart and soul.<br \/> <br \/> Under Top Producer Norbert Leitner the album is going to release on 30th April 2021, which will support building up the status of AUTUMN BRIDE. The fanbase will rejoice and increase rapidly and find salvation together with the Band and their voice: “For me, AUTUMN BRIDE, is like the cradle of music. It feels like I always belonged here and nowhere else! As if all my paths in life led me to exactly those Musicians, exactly this Band.

No heat. A glacial wall of denser-than-dense sound.<br \/> Dallas Texas’ Frozen Soul lives up to their name as the sound of death metal at its most cold and classic. Riff after slow, grinding riff, there’s no mistaking the themes of isolation and suffering that permeate the quintet’s massive sonic missives. From the first note of the Century Media debut, Crypt of Ice, it's like the march of Game of Thrones’ Night King put to sound: nothing subtle about it at all. “The feeling I’m getting from playing in Frozen Soul is powerful in a way I wasn’t getting from other bands I’ve played in before,” says frontman Chad Green. “The sound. The lyrics. Even the logo itself has a harshness to it that just feels powerful and cold. Add to that the depression of dealing with real life and the venomous people that can inhabit it and the vibe of the band just makes sense.”<br \/> Frozen Soul’s brand of straightforward, in-your-face death metal is a gasp of fresh air in a genre that’s stretched the very limits of technicality. Fully formed in 2018, the quintet has rapidly made a name for itself and churned the underground with a sound that evokes the old school sound of bands like Obituary, Mortician and Bolt Thrower. That reverence for death metal’s roots was apparent from Frozen Soul’s initial four-song Encased In Ice demo (which includes a cover of Mortician’s “Witch’s Coven”) that was released in early 2019 on California's cave dwelling, knuckle dragging, Maggot Stomp Records.<br \/> Not that Frozen Soul’s journey has exactly been overnight. The band’s roots can be etched back to 2007 in Green’s time as drummer in Metallic Hardcore turned Death Metal band, End Times. With early influences including Trial, Ringworm and Integrity or Texas’ heroes, Iron Age,” he recalls. “That led me back to my roots – which was, of course, bands like Metallica, and Slayer. From there I fell down the rabbit hole into bands like Grave, Bolt Thrower and Obituary. Eventually, I realized that even if I was playing hardcore, all we were doing was writing death and thrash riffs, anyways!” Blame it on the power of the blunt-force riff and a love for death metal’s past, but in part, blame it on being a band from Texas, a state whose metal roots run deep. From Pantera to Power Trip, sheer heaviness runs in Frozen Soul’s home state’s musical bloodstream. “I think being from here gives any band some big shoes to fill,” states Chad. “That’s why Texas has so many great metal, punk, and hardcore bands.”<br \/> A chance 2016 meeting with guitarist Michael Munday at a local comic book shop over a game of Magic: The Gathering laid the foundation for Frozen Soul. The two had an instant chemistry and shared love for the likes of games, music and well of course, Bolt Thrower, that became the primordial ooze from which Frozen Soul would eventually emerge.<br \/> “It all started when we were trying to rekindle End Times, were writing riffs that were a little too heavy for what End Times was going for,” recalls Chad. “The first full song that we wrote for Frozen Soul was ‘Hand of Vengeance’, which came together quickly! It had a different sort of influence and pushed us to do something new which became Frozen Soul.” With End Times guitarist and Crypt of Ice producer\/mixer Daniel Schmuck – who has also worked with the likes of Creeping Death and Power Trip – Frozen Soul came together quickly. Bassist, and Tattoo Artist Samantha Mobley, along with Drummer Brady Tripp would fill in the starting lineup and by early 2019, the band recorded their inaugural demo and played a near sold-out first show in March, opening a stacked bill topped by death metal contenders, Blood Incantation and Necrot. “We had quite a few people from our hometown at the show that had no idea we were a local band, asking where we were touring from.” says Chad. The band circulated through members which led to the addition of Green's longtime friend and Drummer Matt Dennard, together hit the road to the West Coast by the Summer. In October they followed the West Coast tour up a run through the Midwest with thrash crossover monsters, Plague Years. “Every show on both of our first two tours were great, which felt incredible, especially for a band with just one four-song demo!” the frontman admits. A steady diet of in between local gigs with the likes of Gatecreeper, Exhumed, Vader and Obituary, really got their name out there among the local Texas scene, but hitting the frozen roads of the east coast<br \/> in January 2020 with Death Thrashers Steel Bearing Hand brought their icy reign full circle solidifying their spot nationally. With every show, the band became a more oppressive wall of sound, a snow-machine enhanced atmosphere. “The Frozen Steel tour in January was one of the best experiences in my life and playing a packed show at Saint Vitus in Brooklyn was a huge accomplishment for us,” remembers Chad. “It was one of those moments, playing a legendary club that you never imagined being able to play that makes you ask yourself, have we finally arrived, have we made it?!.”<br \/> In truth, Frozen Soul had arrived and both fans and the metal press had given them the stamp of approval. Just a few months after its release, the band’s singular demo-turned-EP was already winning them high praise in many year-end critics’ polls. Brooklyn Vegan pegged Frozen Soul for one of the most anticipated metal albums of 2020 and Invisible Orange’s writer Rhys Williams gave Encased In Ice the #4 spot in his Top 10 records of 2019.<br \/> In another surprise turn, the band received a call from Century Media and found themselves inking a worldwide deal with the label. “We were surprised ourselves at just how quickly this had all come together,” Chad admits. “But honestly, we 100% never expected this.” With its line-up filled out by Steel Bearing Hand bassist, Chris Bonner playing second guitar, Frozen Soul entered the studio in early March 2020 to record its first full-length with former guitarist Daniel Schmuck handling production and mixing duties. While the shadow of the encroaching Covid-19 pandemic loomed over the recording, the band got focused and delivered. Crypt of Ice is nothing short of a breath of very fresh and very cold air on death metal’s fiery landscape. From re-recorded demo tracks including the frigid call-to-arms of “Encased In Ice” and the savage frost blister of Wraith of Death, to the brutal, pummeling and momentous guitar churn of Arctic Stranglehold, Frozen Soul have delivered a record that embraces the genre’s past whilst pushing death metal forward with frigid force.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/frozen-soul\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QgQM5BQV3AY","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"frozen_soul_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/frozen_soul_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27534}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2350,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/frozensoultx\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2351,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/frozensoultx\/?hl=de"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2352,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/frozensoultx?lang=de"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"1hwwmQI1vhQamuIksyDKG6","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/4\/0\/csm_frozen_soul_2023_900baf38ac.jpg","uid":799}],"country":[],"pathSegment":"frozen-soul","title":"Frozen Soul","uid":624}],"end":"1691163900","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2560","subtitle":"","title":"Wasteland Stage","uid":11},"start":"1691161200","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1023},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"neverland-in-ashes","pid":176,"title":"Neverland In Ashes","uid":631},"biography":"<p>Coming soaring out of Cologne’s high flying metal scene, Neverland In Ashes are a deeply emotional modern metal group looking to push boundaries.

The band’s two preceding releases, the self titled 2018 debut EP and the 2020 debut album ‘Underperformer’, proved EYES as a band on its own path, with both heart and brains to match it. With its genre defying musical approach and introspective generational lyrics, ‘Underperformer’ marked an innovative freshness in the hardcore scene. Despite obstacles from a pandemic, the band left an indelible impression with performances on festivals such as Copenhell (DK) and by:Larm (NO), while the remix release ‘Reperformer’ contributed to the band’s air of unpredictability.<\/p>\r\n<p>EYES’ new album is entitled ‘Congratulations’, even though there isn’t much to cheer about at the moment. The album is a further development of EYES’ sound and style with the band focusing even more than before on melody, off kilter hooks and deep grooves throughout the album’s ten songs collectively shaping an unpredictable, rough rocking and catchy hardcore record produced razor sharply by Jacob Bredahl (LLNN, Lifesick a.o.). The precise songwriting and the music’s urgency exist without omitting the constantly lurking chaos, an essential element in the band’s sound, style and approach. A chaos which is a key component in the band’s spirit itself; an existential unrest, which harshly presents itself in singer Victor Kaas’ lyrics and vocal delivery.<br \/> <br \/> Distrust among people and conspiracy theories, war and environmental catastrophe on the horizon, economic downfall and increasing inequality. The Western world anno. 2023 is the foundation of ‘Congratulations’ and its volatile, confrontational songs. Opposite the internalized thematics of&nbsp; ‘Underperformer’, the doubting self reflection has now turned into anger and a feeling of powerlessness towards a world, where the rich get richer and living conditions are worsened for everyone else. A world, where the younger generations are abandoned again and again. A world, where the only available distraction is to scream into an infinite digital void or to find an alternative reality while looking down on the so-called sheep following the flock and false prophets.<br \/> <br \/> ‘Generation L’ is a song about a generation of losers - the first to possess less funds and possibilities than the generations before, who have been busy fucking over the planet. ‘Tearjerker’ is about you and me on the edge of despair, caused by the steadfastness of the powers that be - do we give up now? ‘The City’ is a despairing hate song to the city you once loved, that has now been conquered by rich people, neatness and bullshit. The title track ‘Congratulations!’ is one big, sarcastic applause to the conspiracy theorists, who’ve found the truth, which cannot be debated. And ‘Ballast’ is the idealist, who once believed in the good of mankind, in art and solidarity - is the dream over? The despair is palpable and the occasion for celebration remains absent for all but those having seen the light. Maybe the time has come to destroy it all and create it anew?<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/eyes\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ARZXwQU0LHg","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"eyes_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/eyes_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27531}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2341,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/eyesbandcph"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2342,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/eyesbandcph\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"6H3XsRIiUv0xVicrxWIHIJ","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/0\/2\/csm_eyes_2023_a2943a7986.jpg","uid":796}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Dänemark","uid":56}],"pathSegment":"eyes","title":"Eyes","uid":621}],"end":"1691180100","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2560","subtitle":"","title":"Wasteland Stage","uid":11},"start":"1691177400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1026},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"konvent","pid":176,"title":"Konvent","uid":546},"biography":"<p>After their debut full-length album, Puritan Masochism, took the entire doom and heavy metal scene by storm upon its release in 2020, critically acclaimed Danish blackened death doom outfit KONVENT returns with a sophomore offering that doubles down on the band’s songwriting talent and brutal, heavy sound!<\/p>\r\n<p>The sonic evolution of KONVENT over the course of just two years is immediately evident on Call Down The Sun, surprising with new elements at every turn. Undoubtedly inspired by recent dark times, the ongoing pandemic and cancellation of live performances, the new album sees the Copenhagen-based band more pissed off, fast-paced and pitch black throughout. Rikke Emilie List’s guttural, sublime growls and fierce screams perfectly integrate with a heavy as hell wall of blackened death and funeral doom metal riffs from guitarist Sara Helena Nørregaard, backed by a thick, profound rhythm section provided by bassist Heidi Withington Brink and drummer Julie Simonsen. Tracks such as “Grains” – a ground-shaking, stomping black doom metal epos that will be a must-hear on KONVENT’s upcoming live setlists – showcase the band’s deep black soul with a hint of post-metal and even progressive elements. Featuring a haunting violin and cello guest performance by Felix Havstad, the band creates dark, eerie yet epic atmosphere on “Harena”, revealing threatening yet beautiful facets of their sound. With songs such as “Pipe Dreams” and massive album opener “Into the Distance”, the four-piece unleashes hurricanes of blackened death doom metal.<\/p>\r\n<p>Recorded and mixed by Lasse Ballade at Ballade Studios, Sweden and mastered by Brad Boatright at Audiosiege Studio, the new album’s thunderous apocalyptic sound is impossible to escape.

Darin begibt er sich auf einen Streifzug durch gut ein halbes Jahrhundert Heavy Metal und legt mal eben dessen Seele frei - mit allem Pathos, den liebgewonnen Klischees und seinem Nutzen als Lebenshilfe oder Ventil für abgründige Gefühle. \"Das Metal-Manifest\" macht ein Fass ohne Boden auf und lässt Lücken, die ihr selbst mit Sinn füllen müsst.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Ernie - Jahrgang \"Heaven and Hell\" respektive \"British Steel\" oder \"Angel Witch\" und \"Frost and Fire\", um es untergründiger zu umschreiben - kommt von Nu zu True und Post zu Female-Fronted, von Metallica zu Mayhem und von Sabaton zu Sarcófago. Höchst unterhaltsam und zutiefst subjektiv schlägt er die 20 Thesen des Metal an - wenn nicht kirchen-, so doch auf jeden Fall schädelspaltend.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Auf sehr vielen Seiten mit über 100 Bildern erzählt der Plattenkritiken verfassende Plattenkritikenhasser Sach- und Krachgeschichten über garantiert nicht kanonische Mixtapes, für ihn die Welt bedeutende Alben, die Schubladisierung des Genres und die Spezies Homo Heavycus Metallicus allgemein. \"Das Metal Manifest\" ist ein Füllhorn an Nerd-Wissen und persönlichen Weisheiten. Es wird biografisch, geht unter die Haut und bietet nicht nur mit seinem Exkurs in die Filmografie des Metal ganz großes Kino.<\/p>\r\n<p>Wenn Ernie seine ganz unakademische (aber bebrillte) Sicht der historischen Dinge wiedergibt, gewinnen selbst alteingesessene Eisenwarenhändler völlig neue Einsichten in die \"beste Musik der Welt\". Hier werden also keine Allgemeinplätze abgeklappert… Natürlich nicht, denn ihr wisst ja: Die Zeit ist zu schade für Scheiße!<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> Bio<\/p>\r\n<p>Ernie Fleetenkieker. Jahrgang ´80, Brille, Hut, Schnorres. YouTuber, Musiker, Kolumnist, angehender Pornostar. Hörte zeitweilig mit Musik auf, weil ihm alles auf die Nerven ging, startete mit einem YouTube-Kanal. Krachmucker TV. Eigensinnig, aber ambitionslos. Weil, wen soll das interessieren? Hauptsache etwas gegen die Leere machen. Ungeplant schalteten aber Woche um Woche viel mehr Menschen ein, als geplant, trotzdem fehlte etwas. Wurde dann von Micha-el Goehre auf zwei Metal-Slams eingeladen, gewann beide und steht seitdem wieder auf der Bühne. Auch schon in Wacken, dem Rock Hard Festival oder auf dem Full Force. Mit Texten. Zumeist über Metal. Aber auch das reichte nicht und Ernie schrieb ein Buch. Als das fertig war, begann er ein zweites, aber das ist eine andere Geschichte.<br \/> &nbsp;<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/krachmucker-tv\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PqE33W0AWDE","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"krachmucker_tv_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/krachmucker_tv_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27879}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2538,"uri":"https:\/\/www.krachmuckertv.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2539,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/krachmuckerTV\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2540,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/krachmuckertv\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2541,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/krachmuckertv"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/9\/c\/csm_krachmucker_tv_2023_cfa03e36b3.jpg","uid":853}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"krachmucker-tv","title":"Krachmucker TV","uid":663}],"end":"1691161200","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691197200","start":"1691128800","title":"Friday","uid":15},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2688","subtitle":"","title":"Welcome To The Jungle","uid":13},"start":"1691157600","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1104},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"kay-ray","pid":176,"title":"Kay Ray","uid":662},"biography":"<p>Aus Berufung und Leidenschaft und seit fast 30 Jahren ist Kay Ray<\/p>\r\n<p>hardest working man in showbiz.

Eine Führung durch die ganze Welt der Idiotie, die Einsicht, dass nichts menschlicher ist als das Missgeschick, seltsame Berichte vom Rand der schiefen Ebene, dann ergänze ich den Abend noch mit Schilderungen, die ich mir auf gar keinen Fall verkneifen kann, mache den Sack zum Ende hin mit einer sehr guten Geschichte zu, und wenn Sie dann noch können, hagelts Zugaben.

They currently have five albums, two EP’s and a live DVD on their name, including guest performances from the titans of the scene, among others: Sharon Den Adel (WITHIN TEMPTATION), Marco Hietala (NIGHTWISH), Alissa White-Gluz (ARCH ENEMY), Burton C. Bell (FEAR FACTORY). Having toured the globe with bands like<\/p>\r\n<p>NIGHTWISH, SABATON and WITHIN TEMPTATION, and having rocked festivals like WACKEN, GRASPOP, DOWNLOAD and FORTAROCK, DELAIN have strongly carved their niche within the scene. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The band is currently working on the follow up to their chart hitting record Moonbathers, due<\/p>\r\n<p>2019. Bridging the gap between studio records is their first ever live DVD “A Decade of Delain - Live at Paradiso” released October 2017, and - proving themselves to one of the most productive bands in the game - Delain are now announcing an exciting new release due late 2018!<\/p>\r\n<p>From humble origins in Zwolle, Netherlands, to their current status as one of the hottest bands in the entire heavy music world, Delain have written their own story, with every successive chapter taking them deeper into the spotlight’s glare. They began life as a symphonic metal band with big ambitions and bigger ideas, led by keyboard maestro Martijn Westerholt and the supreme vocal talents of Charlotte Wessels. Emerging at a time when the world was clearly in need of music with a big heart and a grand vision, the Dutch crew made an immediate impact with their 2006 debut album Lucidity, singles Frozen and See Me In Shadow \/and\/ the extensive touring that followed, wherein these young musicians swiftly developed a reputation for putting on a dazzling show. In the decade that has followed Lucidity’s release, Delain have marched remorselessly forward, gaining momentum and winning over thousands of converts with each successive album and tour. Their most significant breakthrough came with 2012’s We Are The Others, and now, two years on from the release of fourth album The Human Contradiction, Delain are back to further cement their status as modern metal champions.<\/p>\r\n<p>The release of Delain’s fifth album, the stunning Moonbathers, looks certain to further enhance their already sturdy reputation. In collaboration with guitarists Timo Somers and Merel Bechtold, bassist Otto Schimmelpenninck van der Oije and drummer Ruben Israel, Charlotte Wessels and Martijn Westerholt have conjured what is plainly the most diverse, daring and powerful album of<\/p>\r\n<p>Delain’s remarkable story so far. Ranging from the thunderous pomp and melodic might of opener<\/p>\r\n<p>Hands Of Gold and the brooding rush of Suckerpunch through to the dark, exploratory grandeur<\/p>\r\n<p>of Chrysalis – The Last Breath and an exhilarating cover of unsung Queen gem Scandal (originally from the British legends’ album The Miracle), Moonbathers showcases the blossoming of the Dutch band’s creativity and collective chemistry.<\/p>\r\n<p>“What we usually do at the beginning of an album process is consider what we liked and didn’t like about the album before, and we realized that we really liked the production on The Human Contradiction. We deliberately chose to keep certain factors similar to that,” explains Martijn, who took the producer position for this album, as he did on their previous one. “We worked together with the same mixing team, the same master, and the same classical arranger, and in that sense we continued where we left off.” When it comes to the songs themselves it’s a different story. “We had the luxury problem of doing back to back tours.” Mentions Charlotte. “As we didn’t have the time to take a break from touring long enough to write and record an entire album, we decided upfront to chop up the entire process into three chunks, in order to utilize the smaller timeframes between tours and give the songs the time and attention they needed. As a result, it’s a very varied album. It’s an album of extremes: the heavy songs are heavier, the ballad more sensitive, and then there’s songs with a real rock vibe, and that’s due to the way we recorded it, in different times, in different places and in different moods.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Renowned for penning lyrics that resonate with Delain’s huge fan base, Charlotte has excelled herself on Moonbathers, drawing from her personal experiences and taking inspiration from literature and cinema to compose the band’s darkest but deepest set of mysterious messages yet.<\/p>\r\n<p>“I was looking at the lyrics and some of them were dark to the point of being morbid!” she laughs. “There is a lot of thought about endings, both figuratively and very literally; songs about death. Negative emotions are a trigger for my creativity, but though most of my lyrics originate there, I don’t want to glorify it. So as a lyricist I try to make sure that there is always some sort of light at the end of the tunnel. I also realized that when I feel bad, it is sad music more than anything that makes me feel better. So I embraced the idea that it’s possible to find comfort there, and I went looking for a metaphor for finding that light in the darkness, the ultimate icon of that, for me, is the moon. So I chose moonbathers, rather than sunbathers, as a metaphor for those who find comfort in darkness.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Martijn looks back with a smile: “Moonbathers turned out fantastic. The productional quality, heaviness, contrast between light and heavy parts is very refreshing. The sound is exactly what we were were aiming for. Heavy but transparant, I think we achieved the typical Delain style now. Very recognizable, and with it’s own identity.”<\/p>\r\n<p>The sky’s the limit for this most ambitious and enthusiastic of bands. Moonbathers proves that their artistic impulses are still firing with full force and with an ever-expanding global audience anticipating their return to the live arena, this band are plainly on the fast track to ever greater and more enduring success.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/delain\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q3XmiNTjGhA","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":false,"title":"WOA 2019","uid":1},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"delain-2019.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2019\/delain-2019.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":22765}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":150,"uri":"http:\/\/www.delain.nl\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":151,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/delainmusic"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":152,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/delainofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":153,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/delainmusic?lang=de"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":154,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/delainofficial"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"6pIRdCtSE5hLFfIfcTAicI","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/7\/3\/csm_delain-2019_20233123e6.jpg","uid":43},{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"delain","pid":176,"title":"Delain","uid":42},"biography":"<p>Dutch symphonic rockers DELAIN have been releasing and performing their signature catchy melodic metal sound worldwide for over a decade now.

It was this attitude and clear vision that saw the band quickly write and release their second album CLOUD FACTORY in 2014, and venture into the international touring market for the first time, booking their own shows and building their reputation face to face, fan to fan and more importantly under their own terms.<\/p>\r\n<p>It was this intensity that caught the attention of Napalm Records, who quickly signed JINJER, leading to the release of their critically acclaimed third album KING OF EVERYTHING in 2016, as well as the game changing single video for PISCES, which gained the band new fans, millions of views\/streams and countless reaction videos on Youtube. KING OF EVERYTHING showcased the musical prowess and growth of the entire band while opening the floodgates to a bigger International touring circuit which JINJER gladly took advantage of. By the end of nearly two years of non-stop touring in Europe, JINJER added new territories such as Israel, Philippines, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, America, Canada and most of Latin America, while sharing the stages and touring with the likes of Arch Enemy, Cradle Of Filth and DevilDriver.<\/p>\r\n<p>Somewhere between touring vans, visa applications, and flights to new tour destinations, JINJER buried themselves in the rehearsal room to compose 5 brand new tracks for what would become the MICRO EP, written not only for the fans but for themselves, as they needed something new to keep their sanity on the road. Released in January 2019 and coinciding with their European Tour start together with Soilwork and Amorphis, the MICRO EP spawned the instant fan favorites APE and PERENNIAL, climbing to the top of many industry charts and radio station lists worldwide and once again showcased the musical growth and songwriting talent of the band, as well as Tatiana's amazing vocal range.<\/p>\r\n<p>In October 2019 JINJER turned on the heat even more with the release of their third album MACRO. Once again written and recorded between non-stop touring, MACRO's sheer intensity and straight up technical brilliance propelled them to a whole new level in the metal scene, spawning eight videos including the huge hits JUDGEMENT (&amp; PUNISHMENT), RETROSPECTION and HOME BACK, and once again raising the bar and gaining massive respect by fans, press and peers alike.<\/p>\r\n<p>As JINJER finished out the year with their heads still rolling from the sold out Macro World Tours in North America and Europe, the band started 2020 off with high hopes with sold out performances in Tel Aviv, Australia and Latin America. Unfortunately due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they played their final show in Mexico at the Hell &amp; Heaven Festival which not only ended their touring plans abruptly but was probably the last metal festival on the planet. Still, never ones to ever give up, JINJER rallied together and in September 2020, they played 6 shows in Europe becoming the very first international band to cross borders to perform live during the pandemic. In November 2020, JINJER released their very first live album and concert video ALIVE IN MELBOURNE, which was filmed one week before the lockdown hit, giving not only their fans but themselves some hope that better days were on the way.<\/p>\r\n<p>In August 2021, to the surprise and delight of fans, JINJER released their most ambitious album to date: WALLFLOWERS, presenting a methodical and premeditated next step in the band's already imposing career, but moreover, mirroring the personal adversities they’ve faced during the worldwide events over the last few years. WALLFLOWERS is not only an upgrade to the progressive groove metal sound that all JINJER fans crave, but also a sonic pressure cooker of technical musicianship, emotional fury and an intense soundtrack befitting the harrowing state of the world today. From the blast beat laden banger COLOSSUS, to the 90s grunge vibe of DISCLOSURE! and dynamically blazing MEDIATOR, to the dark and gloomy psychedelic ride of WALLFLOWER and blistering urgency of tracks such as VORTEX and AS I BOIL ICE – the unbridled heaviness and personality proved to be another standout addition to JINJER’s already widely celebrated catalog, and a new standard for creativity in Modern Metal as a whole.<\/p>\r\n<p>JINJER closed 2021 with over 70 concerts including many summer festivals, a short tour of mainland Europe and a hugely successful two month North American Tour, proving to the band and their fans that Metal music is here to stay ... and so are JINJER … to be continued.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/jinjer\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a98LI-arNS4","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"jinjer-2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/jinjer-2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27090}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1936,"uri":"http:\/\/jinjer-metal.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1937,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JinjerOfficial"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":1938,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/dmitriyoksen"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"7o6cOczXTB8ioTAAJTbESf","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/9\/4\/csm_jinjer-2023_772b0722db.jpg","uid":688}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Ukraine","uid":217}],"pathSegment":"jinjer","title":"Jinjer","uid":44}],"end":"1691244900","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"512","subtitle":"","title":"Faster","uid":4},"start":"1691241300","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1029},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"killswitch-engage","pid":176,"title":"Killswitch Engage","uid":559},"biography":"<p class=\"gmail-p1\">Recently recognized by Forbes as \"<a href=\"https:\/\/atomsplitterpr.us6.list-manage.com\/track\/click?u=db1855ab84d45f76eff7f68dd&amp;id=d09295b8d5&amp;e=542c32d7d1\">one of modern metal's most cherished acts<\/a>,\" KsE first shook the structure of heavy music upon climbing out of snowy industrialized Western Massachusetts in 1999.

Then, again most groups aren't German extreme metal masters HEAVEN SHALL BURN. Indeed, the follow-up to 2016's celebrated Wanderer full-length is a double album. Titled, Of Truth and Sacrifice, and featuring 19 tracks covering 97-minutes of runtime, the Germans needed to get this out of their system. To accomplish their vision, they pulled back from “the cycle”—writing, recording, touring, repeat—to focus solely on the songs and the message that would eventually comprise Of Truth and Sacrifice. They also sought out diversity. By bringing in composer Sven Helbig (Rammstein, Pet Shop Boys) and renowned conductor Wilhelm Keitel, HEAVEN SHALL BURN added a string section to their formidable sound. And so, without bookers, managers, and label reps in their ear, HEAVEN SHALL BURN set out on a nearly four-year journey to capture their aggression, their hopes, and to realize two full-length albums as powerful in song as they are illuminating on message. Split between two halves—”Of Truth” and “Of Sacrifice,” respectively—Of Truth and Sacrifice is HEAVEN SHALL BURN at their most intense, insightful, and adventurous.<br \/> “We had a feeling that it was about time to leave the music biz rat race for a while,” Maik Weichert, founding member\/guitarist, says. “We have always refused to be part of these mechanisms, but still, we have to follow these things. Maybe we’re a bit ‘slower?’ Regarding music, these mechanisms kill creativity and real emotion, so we just wanted to approach our new record without having to be prepared for a tour or a festival run. Some bands start songwriting with a release date in mind. That is exactly what we did not want. Working on this record without any deadline was a great feeling of freedom.”<br \/> As for how Of Truth and Sacrifice started, the title and concept were first. The HEAVEN SHALL BURN primaries had to discuss the complexities of “truth” in an era of “fake news,” the burden to “sacrifice” oneself to get to the “truth,” and how the two concepts are related not lexically but in modern life. With the concept nailed down, the Thuringia-based quintet rolled out the cover songs to get the energy right. Since forming in 1997, this is how the songwriting process has typically set off. HEAVEN SHALL BURN kept their cover of Nuclear Assault’s “Critical Mass,” including it near the end of “Of Sacrifice,” because it felt right in the context of Of Truth and Sacrifice. The heaviness and vibrancy of the cover sparked a whirlwind of creativity. The songwriting team—of which Weichert is an integral part—rifled riff after riff and song after song, with “Children of a Lesser God” emerging as the first complete song. Surprisingly, the songwriting effort took longer than usual but went forward without a hitch.<br \/> “Of Truth and Sacrifice is a lot more diverse,” says Weichert. “I guess VETO and Wanderer are important and relatable forerunners to Of Truth and Sacrifice. Without these records, Of Truth and Sacrifice would not exist. It is an evolution. If it’s the peak—or still on the rise or already descending in quality—is not something I have to think about. I think Of Truth and Sacrifice is a lot more emotional in many ways, more aggressive, more passionate, more determined, but also more melancholic and more relaxed. We’ve always tried to be a musical Theatrum Mundi, mixing and showing all our influences. I think this approach is even more obvious on Of Truth and Sacrifice. It felt great and natural to bring this record to life.”<br \/> Conceptually, Of Truth and Sacrifice is very personal to HEAVEN SHALL BURN. The hypocrisy of “truth” in the modern era, whether spread through social media or by leaders of the free world, is unbearable to behold. The fact that our world is slowly sliding backward is even more terrible. There is no progress in the degeneration of humanity's capacity to think independently, to understand facts, to transform facts into knowledge, and to cement knowledge into wisdom, and, in turn, translate wisdom into action. To correct course, “sacrifice” will be needed to ensure victory over the dimming and dumbing down of humankind. From “Thoughts and Prayers” and “What War Means” to “Children of a Lesser God” and “Übermacht,” HEAVEN SHALL BURN posited missives of incredulity, alienation, disconcertment, and angst. Across Of Truth and Sacrifice, the Germans violently vent their vexations.<br \/> “It makes me sick that today so many people talk of ‘alternative facts’ and ‘opinions’ in places where only the truth is the real thing,” Weichert says. “Of course, people can have their opinions and points of view, but not if clear morals and non-negotiable rights of men are discussed. So many people sacrifice for the truth—just think of journalists getting killed or teachers in Africa that try to bring education and ‘enlightenment’ to poor people. Meanwhile, so many people sacrifice the truth and choose ignorance, just to not change their lives. They’d rather believe lies to continue an existence in nescience and heteronomy. The saddest thing is that many of them do not even decide to be ignorant and blind. They’re raised that way. This is the definition of degeneration.”<br \/> To visualize HEAVEN SHALL BURN’s communiqué on Of Truth and Sacrifice, they enlisted artist Eliran Kantor. Known for his vibrant, realistic, and emotive style for artists such as Testament, Iced Earth, and Sodom, Kantor’s cover art depicts a heavily wounded female warrior (and mother) protecting and defending a naked child with her shield and sword. Yes, “sacrifice” is part of the message. As for the rest, it’s up to HEAVEN SHALL BURN’s ardent fanbase to determine whether the naked (read: vulnerable) child represents “truth” or something else. HEAVEN SHALL BURN want their acolytes to read further into the cover. As with most paintings (i.e., the “classics”) from which Of Truth and Sacrifice is modeled, there’s tremendous detail and meaning throughout. Indeed, the cover art is part of Of Truth and Sacrifice's hefty sum.<br \/> “[The cover art] was a long and hard process,” says Weichert. “I could feel Eliran's artistic fight with the basic concept. We discussed it a lot and it came out great, I think. In my opinion, it is one of the most demanding and sophisticated pieces he's ever done. We put a lot of cultural-historic allusions and citations into the artwork—there is so much stuff to discover—I will not betray anything here. Eliran can be proud of it. At least, I am proud that he did this cover for us.”<br \/> HEAVEN SHALL BURN recorded Of Truth and Sacrifice with guitarist Alexander Dietz at his Chemical Burn Studios in Germany. The band were able to engineer, record, and produce their new album over two years, usually when Dietz's studio wasn't occupied with another artist. This afforded the band the time and space needed to put in the work without the usual time watching and budget calculating that goes into a studio (or studios) session. Once they finished tracking Of Truth and Sacrifice, HEAVEN SHALL BURN hired studio wizard Tue Madsen (Meshuggah, The Haunted) to mix at his recently renovated Antfarm Studio in Denmark. From there, Eike Freese (Deep Purple, Apocalyptica) mastered the 19-song behemoth at Chameleon Studios in Germany. From the brutal assault of “Eradicate” and the melancholic timbre of instrumental “The Ashes of My Enemies” to the hard-hearted pulse of “La Résistance” and the ultra-intense “Truther,” Of Truth and Sacrifice sounds massive and tough yet bright and expansive.<br \/> “If you have a top-notch studio in the band, why not use it,” Weichert says. “We could come and go when we wanted. So, we booked the studio for a whole year, so we could do what we want when we wanted. The whole thing was a process over two years. We did not have deadlines or schedules in the studio. We just did things when it was time. We recorded demos, and these demo tracks were redesigned piece-by-piece into the final tracks. I would also mention that we wanted a strong production team, too. And we got it. We have a strong line of great people who work together perfectly. Usually, too many cooks spoil the broth, but these guys boosted each other’s work.”<br \/> With Of Truth and Sacrifice waiting for release in March 2020, there’s ample time for HEAVEN SHALL BURN to plot their next steps. First and foremost is the promotion of the Germans’ documentary, Mein grünes Herz in dunklen Zeiten (My Green Heart in Dark Times), directed by famed filmmaker Ingo Schmoll (Kraftklub, MTV Europe, Rockpalast WDR TV). Never a band to miss associating time and place with their art, the documentary title plays on Thuringia’s nickname Das grüne Herz Deutschlands (The Green Heart of Germany). While limited-edition versions of Of Truth and Sacrifice will include the 80-minute documentary, HEAVEN SHALL BURN and Century Media are checking the logistics of bringing the film to theaters in Germany. Clearly, Of Truth and Sacrifice isn’t just a double album but rather a multi-media event designed to relay an important message. It welcomes and celebrates the return of HEAVEN SHALL BURN.<br \/> “Right now, we are getting ready for this summer’s festivals (Rock am Ring, Rock im Park, Full Force, Hell Fest, Masters of Rock),” says Weichert. “We did not play live for two years, so we have to get in shape. But it<br \/> already feels great during rehearsals, and we cannot wait to go on stage again! The new record will dominate 2020. We’ll do a lot of promotion and even more videos and stuff. We’ll also work on a European tour, of course. Other parts of the world will also be toured, but we’ll see how much time we have. 2021 will be as intense as this year!”<\/p>\r\n<p>Line-Up:<br \/> Maik Weichert - Guitar<br \/> Alexander Dietz - Guitar<br \/> Marcus Bischoff - Vocals<br \/> Eric Bischoff - Bass<br \/> Christian Bass – Drums<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/heaven-shall-burn\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5vwe__7NtoY","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"heaven_shall_burn_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/heaven_shall_burn_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27389}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2178,"uri":"https:\/\/www.heavenshallburn.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2179,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/officialheavenshallburn\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2180,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/heavenshallburnofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2181,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/heavenshallburntv"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"4sy5qWfwUwpGYBnCKnwfcW","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/f\/5\/csm_heaven_shall_burn_2023_8756552632.jpg","uid":749}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"heaven-shall-burn","title":"Heaven Shall Burn","uid":579}],"end":"1691266500","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"512","subtitle":"","title":"Faster","uid":4},"start":"1691261100","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1031},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"dropkick-murphys","pid":176,"title":"Dropkick Murphys","uid":358},"biography":"<p>Dropkick Murphys formed in 1996 in Boston, MA.

In the true spirit of punk rock we view the band and the audience as one in the same; in other words our stage and our microphone are yours.<br \/> <br \/> In addition to hopefully bringing people together for a good time, we hope to share some of our experiences and beliefs in working class solidarity, friendship, loyalty and self- improvement as a means to bettering society (i.e. You can preach till you’re blue in the face but if you’re lying in the gutter no one’s gonna listen. If you pick yourself up by the bootstraps and live your life to the best of your ability you may set an example that others will follow).<br \/> <br \/> Thanks for the support!<br \/> Dropkick Murphys<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/dropkick-murphys\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9d8SzG4FPyM","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"dropkick-murphys-2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/dropkick-murphys-2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27086}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1923,"uri":"http:\/\/www.dropkickmurphys.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1924,"uri":"http:\/\/www.dropkickmurphys.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1925,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DropkickMurphys\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":1926,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dropkickmurphys\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":1927,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DropkickMurphys"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"7w9jdhcgHNdiPeNPUoFSlx","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/2\/a\/csm_dropkick-murphys-2023_8c9868b1a4.jpg","uid":685}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika","uid":220}],"pathSegment":"dropkick-murphys","title":"Dropkick Murphys","uid":358}],"end":"1691278200","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"512","subtitle":"","title":"Faster","uid":4},"start":"1691273700","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1032},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"masterplan","pid":176,"title":"Masterplan","uid":582},"biography":"<p>In 2002, MASTERPLAN was founded by Roland Grapow and Uli Kusch, who both just split ways with Helloween. This new band should turn into a force to be reconned with very quickly: the debut album “Masterplan” made a huge impact on the scene in early 2003. Four highly-acclaimed studio albums were following within the next 10 years. Now MASTERPLAN finally release a Live album, available as BluRay\/CD and DVD\/CD sets, incl. the full Masters Of Rock 2013 show, the Wacken 2014 show, footage from their latest Asian tour, and Prog Power Atlanta festival, plus all (5) official MASTERPLAN video clips. The Masters Of Rock 2013 show is featured on the CD.<br \/> <br \/> When MASTERPLAN was formed in 2002, the band was quickly hailed as THE Melodic Metal sensation. Two ex-Helloween men Roland Grapow and Uli Kusch connected at once with first-class vocalist Jorn Lande, then adding to this mix Axel Mackenrott (keyboards) and bassist Jan S. Eckert. A supergroup was born. The debut album \"Masterplan\" achieved huge impact in 2003, the band celebrating their first chart success throughout whole Europe and the immensely quick buildup of a huge, worldwide fanbase. A European tour with Hammerfall followed in addition. The sophomore album \"Aeronautics\" was released in January 2005 and continued this path. Part of the \"Flying Aces Tour”, MASTERPLAN played their first shows as headlining act. But, for third album (\"MK II\" (2007), change was on the way as singer Lande and drummer Kusch left to be replaced by Mike DiMeo (ex-Riot) and veteran drummer Mike Terrana. On a European tour with Saxon, the new MASTERPLAN line-up was presented for the first time. With the fourth album \"Time To Be King\", Lande briefly returned to MASTERPLAN but sadly, despite numerous requests, no live activity resulted.<br \/> <br \/> For the band’s fifth album “Novum Initium”, (2013) new members Rick Altzi (vocals) and Jari Kainulainen (bass) joined MASTERPLAN and the band not only continued their tradition of releasing outstanding melodic metal, but also returned to the stages for the biggest run of headlining shows and festivals in their entire history so far. The proven new line-up now gives you the first ever MASTERPLAN Live album, titled “Keep Your Dream aLive”).<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/masterplan\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rEIiLZouaJE","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"masterplan_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/masterplan_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27392}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2189,"uri":"https:\/\/masterplan-theband.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2190,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/masterplantheband\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"1OHNvr18TssBKYK0A75yvx","subtitle":"20th Anniversary Show","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/3\/3\/csm_masterplan_2023_0796859cf5.jpg","uid":752}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"masterplan","title":"Masterplan","uid":582}],"end":"1691231400","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"768","subtitle":"","title":"Harder","uid":5},"start":"1691227800","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"20th Anniversary Show","uid":1033},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"ensiferum","pid":176,"title":"Ensiferum","uid":535},"biography":"<p>Ensiferum are a true powerhouse when it comes to folk-inspired melodic death metal, something they hammer home more resolutely than ever with eighth full-length Thalassic. The title translating from ancient Greek as \"of or relating to seas\", it's a suitably huge and wide-ranging collection that incorporates orchestrations and traditional folk instrumentation alongside the roaring guitars, bass, and drums. \"I think we managed to take another step ahead musically and we also utilized the best parts of our old sound,\" states bassist\/vocalist Sami Hinkka. \"There are lots of Ensiferum's trademarks: beautiful folkish melodies, ass-kicking riffs, a nice mix of different vocals and great singalong choruses.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>It's been three years since the towering Two Paths and the quintet kept themselves busy writing over that period. Viewing Two Paths and its predecessor One Man Army (2015) as being something of a pair, this time out they wanted to jump into the unknown and try a new approach, without forgetting their roots. Kicking the album off with the grand orchestral piece \"Seafarer's Dream\" definitely makes an impression, though overall Thalassic scales back a little on such instrumentation. \"I guess that has become kind of a part of Ensiferum's sound, but on this album we actually used orchestrations less than before because the songs turned out to be more straightforward metal. We like to emphasize the story and the feeling of a song with the sounds that fit them best, so using huge orchestrations has to serve the purpose of the song and not be taken for granted and used all the time.\" The likes of \"Rum, Women, Victory\" and \"Run From The Crushing Tide\" are certainly full on metal, but these sit comfortably alongside the jaunty \"Midsummer Magic\" and triumphant \"Andromeda\". The band were helped in realizing these tracks by the addition of new keyboard player\/lead clean vocalist Pekka Montin who \"really raised the new songs to another level\" while Mikko P. Mustonen once again presided over the orchestrations and violin virtuoso Lassi Logren recorded folk instruments on a few tracks.<\/p>\r\n<p>The biggest difference separating Thalassic from the rest of Ensiferum's catalogue comes from the fact that it's the first of their albums to be built around a theme. \"The idea of it started to brew in my mind when I was doing interviews for 'Two Paths' and many journalists asked if it was a theme album, and I noticed that I was answering all the time that because of the way we compose it's almost impossible to make a theme album. This really started to piss me off and the decision was made: the next album would have a theme. At that time, we already had a few songs almost ready for the next album, and I started to listen to the demos much more from the feeling aspect instead of analyzing them musically. For some reason, all of them took me to a seashore, and the theme was found: something related to sea or water. So I started to read about history, myths and legend around the world that had something to do with the theme, but even though all of the lyrics are obviously inspired by this, I tried my best to keep Ensiferum's heroic mentality in them. In the end, there were too many ideas for lyrics, because I didn't set myself any boundaries - like all stories would have to be Nordic, etc, and one of my favourite songs on the album tells about Andromeda from Greek mythology. I can't promise that this way of lyric-writing will be the future of Ensiferum, but at least we did this once.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Thalassic was recorded and produced in Petrax and Sonic Pump studios by Janne Joutsenniemi, who was involved on their albums Victory Songs (2007) and From Afar (2009). \"We like to go to a studio when we have all the songs 99.9% ready so the producer's main job is to kick our asses while we record. Of course Janne Joutsenniemi is a world-class producer, and we asked his opinion if we were doubting any details. It was really a pleasure to work with him again, and I think this was one of the most easy-going studio sessions I have ever been part of. We are extremely happy with the result. It helps a lot when you do proper demos of the songs, then everyone already has a very good picture of how each song will sound.\" Gyula Havanchak handled the artwork and once again raised the Ensiferum standard, creating something that vividly reflects the songs, and indeed the theme running through them. Looking ahead, the band only intend to keep on doing what they do best. \"We are very privileged to be full-time musicians, but you never know what the future brings. I hope we can keep doing the thing we love the most. What I really hope happens is a support tour with much a bigger band because in the folk\/pagan\/battle\/whatever metal scenes everyone knows Ensiferum - so Steve Harris, if you are reading this: we are ready!\"<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/ensiferum\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jgF38ZQJAPU","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"ensiferum-2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/ensiferum-2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27093}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1947,"uri":"https:\/\/ensiferum.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1948,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ensiferum"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"0krXCIkthz13P8o0v2tksH","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/4\/6\/csm_ensiferum-2023_0ee45672b5.jpg","uid":691}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Finnland","uid":67}],"pathSegment":"ensiferum","title":"Ensiferum","uid":535}],"end":"1691240400","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"768","subtitle":"","title":"Harder","uid":5},"start":"1691236800","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1034},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"alestorm","pid":176,"title":"Alestorm","uid":569},"biography":"<p>ALESTORM IS:<\/p>\r\n<p>Christopher Bowes - Vocals &amp; Keytar<\/p>\r\n<p>Máté Bodor - Guitar<\/p>\r\n<p>Gareth Murdock - Bass<\/p>\r\n<p>Elliot Vernon - Keyboards<\/p>\r\n<p>Peter Alcorn – Drums<\/p>\r\n<p>Avast, ye landlubbers!

Sie hätten das damals ja selbst nicht gedacht, sagen Saltatio<br \/> Mortis heute: Dass man mit Schnabelschuhen, Schellenband und Dudelsack irgendwann mit<br \/> vier Nummer-Eins-Alben dasteht und mit einer goldenen Schallplatte noch dazu. Und<br \/> dass es eine so bunte Truppe, auch nach über zwanzig Jahren, immer noch schafft, so<br \/> erfolgreich zu sein, in einer Welt, die zunehmend grau wird – allein das ist ein Zeichen, das<br \/> Hoffnung macht.<br \/> Hoffnung, die im zweiten Jahr der Corona-Ausnahmesituation auch dringend notwendig<br \/> scheint. Auch knapp ein Jahr nach der Veröffentlichung von „Für immer frei” ist von der alten<br \/> Normalität noch nichts zu spüren. Konzerte, wie wir sie kannten, gleichsam das Lebenselixier<br \/> von Saltatio Mortis, gibt es nach wie vor nicht. Die Band fiebert den ersten Auftritten nach<br \/> über 18 Monaten Bühnenabstinenz entgegen und hat für die Käufer der limitierten Auflage<br \/> auch einen kompletten Mitschnitt des besonderen «Corona-Livestream» Konzertes auf DVD<br \/> im Gepäck.<br \/> Doch nicht nur die Welt da draußen hat sich verändert, auch im kleinen Saltatio-Kosmos hat<br \/> sich Einiges getan: Zeitgleich mit dem Release von “Für immer frei” wurde Lasterbalk –<br \/> Gründungsmitglied, Schlagzeuger, Texter und Manager von Saltatio Mortis – Vater einer<br \/> kleinen und sehr bezaubernden Tochter. Kinder verändern die Welt, und so scheidet er aus dem<br \/> zeitintensiven Tourgeschäft aus, um seine Tochter aktiv beim Aufwachsen zu begleiten. Die<br \/> Drumsticks übernimmt Jean und sorgt mit seiner unbändigen Spielfreude für die richtigen<br \/> Beats. Lasterbalk wird weiterhin hinter den Kulissen für die Band da sein und natürlich fleißig<br \/> an neuen Songs mitarbeiten.<br \/> Die ersten Ergebnisse dieser Umwälzungen haben Saltatio Mortis in einer Neuauflage des<br \/> Erfolgsalbums «Für immer frei» zusammengefasst. Neben den markanten Songs des<br \/> Hauptalbums finden sich hier fünf neue Songs und drei alternative Versionen. Mit der Single<br \/> «Nie allein» beschwören Saltatio den Zusammenhalt, den sie auch in der echten Welt leben<br \/> und erleben. Mit «My Mother Told Me» und «Wellerman» sind gleich zwei fremdsprachige<br \/> Songs in den acht neuen Tracks vertreten, die deutlich auf die historischen und folkigen<br \/> Wurzeln der Band verweisen. Schon lange schlägt das Herz der Band auch für die nordische<br \/> Sagenwelt und nicht zuletzt eben auch für neuzeitliche Adaptionen, wie zum Beispiel die<br \/> Erfolgsserie «Vikings». Fans der Serie werden die historische Melodie von «My Mother Told<br \/> Me» bestimmt sofort erkennen, wie auch Fans von «Assasins Creed» einige Figuren in der<br \/> videografischen Umsetzung wiederfinden dürften.<br \/> Es ist genau dieser Spagat, der Saltatio Mortis auszeichnet: Der Spagat zwischen Modernem<br \/> und Historischem…<br \/> „Für immer frei – Unsere Zeit Edition“ heißt das neue Album von Saltatio Mortis, und im<br \/> Titel finden sich Bekenntnis und Aufruf zugleich. Eine stimmige Selbstbeschreibung einer freien<br \/> Band, die sich noch nie um musikalische Grenzen geschert hat. Freie Musik von freien<br \/> Menschen. Denn frei und offen: So ist die Musik dieser Gruppe; so war sie schon immer, seit<br \/> Saltatio Mortis im Jahr 2000 in Karlsruhe zueinander gefunden haben. Aber so neugierig<br \/> und virtuos wie auf diesem Album haben sie vielleicht noch nie an der Erweiterung ihrer<br \/> Möglichkeiten gearbeitet.<br \/> Saltatio Mortis wirken auch nach einundzwanzig Jahren immer noch so kraftvoll,<br \/> leidenschaftlich und neugierig wie am ersten Tag; ihre gewachsene musikalische Reife steigert<br \/> nur noch die Intensität ihrer Songs. „Für immer frei – Unsere Zeit“: Das ist die Musik einer<br \/> Band, die ihre Geschichte kennt und um die Zukunft weiß; die so sicher ist, dass sie kein Risiko<br \/> scheut – und die weiß, dass es heute wichtiger ist denn je, den kräftigen Rock und den zarten<br \/> Folk nicht den Feinden der Freiheit zu überlassen.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/saltatio-mortis\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2Cb0Q9lIRMU","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"saltatio_mortis_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/saltatio_mortis_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27548}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2402,"uri":"https:\/\/www.saltatio-mortis.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2403,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/saltatiomortisofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2404,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/saltatiomortis\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"09Z51O0q4AwHl7FjUUlFKw","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/2\/3\/csm_saltatio_mortis_2023_54416f0bef.jpg","uid":813}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"saltatio-mortis","title":"Saltatio Mortis","uid":319}],"end":"1691260200","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"768","subtitle":"","title":"Harder","uid":5},"start":"1691255700","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1036},{"artists":[{"assets":[],"country":[],"pathSegment":"tba","title":"TBA","uid":479}],"end":"1691268240","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"768","subtitle":"","title":"Harder","uid":5},"start":"1691266500","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1037},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"two-steps-from-hell","pid":176,"title":"Two Steps From Hell","uid":534},"biography":"<p>Thomas Bergersen and Nick Phoenix perform: Two Steps From Hell - Live<\/p>\r\n<p>The master of epic music with orchestra, choir and band<\/p>\r\n<p>WORLD'S #1 EPIC MUSIC PRODUCER<\/p>\r\n<p>Whenever huge emotions, tense anticipation and breath-taking intensity are in the air, the sound of Two Steps From Hell is never far away.

Hambel,&nbsp;Danny Schuler and Evan Seinfeld.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The first wave of confirmed dates for the seminal outfit include multiple international festivals in summer 2023, as well as select appearances in America. See dates below, with more announcements coming soon. In addition to touring,&nbsp;Biohazard&nbsp;have a 35th anniversary documentary in the works containing previously unreleased footage spanning four decades. They also plan on returning to the studio to record new material in early 2023.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>“Biohazard&nbsp;is an iconic band that ripped it up on the streets of New York when I lived there in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, so I’m excited to be working with them to bring their pioneering hardcore sound to a new generation,” says Andy Gould (Rob Zombie, Pantera, Type O Negative). The band is managed by Andy Gould and Paul Gargano, and booked by&nbsp;Jim Morewood at the K2 Agency internationally, and Scott Sokol at Pinnacle in North America.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Biohazard&nbsp;pioneered a genre, with a trailblazing sound that fused elements of hardcore, heavy metal, punk and hip-hop. Expect their live sets to be rife with mosh pit classics from their classic early catalog, including their self-titled debut (1990), ‘Urban Discipline’ (1992) and ’State Of The World Address’ (1994).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>BILLY GRAZIADEL: “Over the years we made some great music together and had so many incredible shows on some pretty amazing tours. After spending much time and focus on PowerFlo and my solo BillyBio, I decided it was the right time to recapture these iconic moments. Always kicking ass and looking for the next challenge, I’m ready to do it with Danny, Bobby and Evan once again!”<\/p>\r\n<p>BOBBY HAMBEL: “I’m honored to perform with the band again. I can’t wait to get onstage with the guys and do what we do! I’m looking forward to traveling and playing live - see you out there!”<\/p>\r\n<p>DANNY SCHULER: “Life is short, things happen, and before you know it, it’s too late - that’s why I’m extremely grateful that we are getting the chance to do this again, forgiving the past and focusing on the future. I’ve missed the band and the great times we’ve had, and I’m looking forward to the shows, the travel, and seeing our friends all over the world again… This is gonna be awesome, let’s go!”&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>EVAN SEINFELD: “It’s been ten years since we all played together, and I’m in a huge place of gratitude for the opportunity to get back to the roots of&nbsp;Biohazard&nbsp;and not only reconnect with the other guys, but also the fans. We’ve been through decades of madness, and it feels like the fantastic four are back together.”&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/biohazard\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5yqrrtThaLM","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"biohazard_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/biohazard_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27518}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2303,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BiohazardDFL"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2304,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/biohazardDFL"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2305,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/biohazarddfl\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"3nhxXtHwC2TookQyqQlFK1","subtitle":"Original Line-Up\r\nExclusive German Festival Gig 23","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/5\/6\/csm_biohazard_2023_1878db87be.jpg","uid":787}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika","uid":220}],"pathSegment":"biohazard","title":"Biohazard","uid":613}],"end":"1691244000","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691240400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"Exclusive German Festival Show","uid":1041},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"kataklysm","pid":176,"title":"Kataklysm","uid":539},"biography":"<p>Thundering with newly fueled power from the shadows and dust of humanity's crumbling existence, <strong>KATAKLYSM <\/strong>return triumphant with their 14th full length studio album: <strong><em>UNCONQUERED<\/em><\/strong>. For almost 3 decades, the French-Canadian melodic death metal syndicate has delivered unapologetic waves of powerful sound across the entire globe. As of late, that globe has suffered tremendously, forcing the inspiration of many artists to extinguish, but for <strong>KATAKLYSM<\/strong>, the pressure caused a creative spring to burst forth with furious energy. “<em>With everything that’s going on in the world, we couldn’t have chosen a better title<\/em>,” explains vocalist <strong>Maurizio Iacono<\/strong>. “<em>This album is a rebirth of aggression for <strong>KATAKLYSM<\/strong>. No one planned this to happen the way it did, but the name of this album makes total sense right now. It’s an aggressive album, yes, but a positive aggression.<\/em>” Themes of fighting back and overcoming the insurmountable seethe through the lyrics and melodies of <strong><em>UNCONQUERED<\/em><\/strong>; consistent, sonic reminders of the battles that lead to triumph.<\/p>\r\n<p>Songs like the hostile first single <strong>“The Killshot<\/strong>” give definition to the steadfast existence of <strong>KATAKLYSM <\/strong>as a whole. “<em>To me, the music delivers the band’s exact meaning. The force behind everything; that driving force of never giving up. We have been here so long now, and these songs represent that very well<\/em>,” describes guitarist <strong>JF Dagenais<\/strong>. Taking this album by the horns, the band had a desire to modernize what they were doing, and to be brutally honest, more so than ever before. “<em>There were some things that I wanted to do a little different, lyrically<\/em>,” explains <strong>Iacono.<\/strong> “<em>The last few years I’ve been struggling with anxiety, and a lot of things related to my environment; things that I see as unjust, unfolding around me. I took a lot of that and put it into this record. It’s a very honest, and forward thinking addition to our catalogue. I think ‘<strong>The Killshot<\/strong>’ is the one that’s <strong>KATAKLYSM<\/strong> saying ‘fuck you’ to those things.<\/em>”<\/p>\r\n<p>The second single “<strong>Cut Me Down<\/strong>” is exponentially haunting and melodic. <em>“It cuts your veins a little bit<\/em>,” describes <strong>Iacono<\/strong>. The song also includes guest vocals from Tuomas Saukkonen of the Finnish metal band Wolfheart. His powerful vocals accompany the track perfectly. “<em>I felt he was the right guy for that part, otherwise, we didn’t need more guests, he just fit. We’ve really covered all the bases from the aggression of the music, to the melodic aspect, to the technicality, but the structures that JF and I put together on this album are what really nailed it<\/em>.” Long nights, whether in person or from a distance, were spent writing and composing this album. <strong>KATAKLYSM<\/strong> fans will hear obvious moments that reflect back to the times of <strong><em>Shadows &amp; Dust <\/em><\/strong>and <strong><em>Serenity In Fire<\/em><\/strong>; Straight forward, no mistakes, no compromises.<\/p>\r\n<p>“<em>It’s so aggressive yet at the same time, easy to listen to<\/em>,” describes <strong>Dagenais<\/strong>. These two elements combined create a murderous, power fueled combo, a deepness and dramatic overtone that is also incredibly uplifting. It is clear that every member of the band gave 200%, pushing themselves far beyond the normal realm of creativity to bring this album into existence. To assist in enhancing the depth of this sound, <strong>Dagenais <\/strong>decided to finally employ for the first time a 7 string guitar, something he’d been craving for quite some time. Like an elephant barreling through a tiny room, the 7 string brings extra punch and weight to the record, enhancing the richness and making it seem as if there are even more guitars playing.<\/p>\r\n<p>When it came time to record the album, <strong>Dagenais<\/strong> dove in furiously with an ingrained desire for perfection. “<em>From the ground up, the first demos to the final thing, I didn’t want to have any regrets with this. I wanted to make sure there was nothing left behind, unfinished, no mistakes<\/em>.” In addition to <strong>Dagenais<\/strong>’s clinical approach to the recording, <strong>KATAKLYSM<\/strong> hired on the legendary <strong>Colin Richardson<\/strong>, post retirement, to aid in the production of <strong><em>UNCONQUERED<\/em><\/strong>’s weightier sound. “<em>We got lucky because he accepted to come back and do this album; the first death metal record he’s done since he retired<\/em>,” recalls <strong>Iacono<\/strong>. With <strong>Chris Clancy<\/strong>’s technicality and precision assisting him, the end result of the sound of <strong><em>UNCONQUERED<\/em><\/strong> can not be understated.<\/p>\r\n<p>This resurgence of old school temperament and musical fury required a clean, and powerful piece of artwork to represent its arrival. The infamous heart beast, which also appeared on <strong><em>In The Arms Of Devastation<\/em><\/strong> (2006), <strong><em>Prevail<\/em><\/strong> (2008), and <strong><em>Heaven’s Venom <\/em><\/strong>(2010), makes its return with a cover image created by artist <strong>Blake Armstrong<\/strong>. This frightening and dominant being sears across a white universe, screaming in both triumph and agony. “<em>The beast kind of started re-emerging by itself, a lot of people have been asking about it lately and wondering about it’s origins, etc. It’s been almost 15 years since it emerged the first time, we didn’t want to repeat the same thing with every record, but we felt like now could be a great time to bring it back, unite the old fans with the new<\/em>,” continues<strong> Iacono<\/strong>. “<em>Another cool thing about the artwork; Blake made it realistic. It’s not just a standard photoshop image, it’s made in such a way that it looks three dimensional; real. We really wanted to bring back the beast in a ‘reality’ setting<\/em>.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Needless to say, creating <strong><em>UNCONQUERED<\/em><\/strong> was an intense, and emotional experience for the band, and will likely make fans feel similarly. “<em>There’s a lot of deepness on this one, a lot of honesty,<\/em>” describes <strong>Iacono<\/strong>. “<em>This is a very personal record for me on the lyrical side of things, in terms of the recent events in my life. Usually, I talk about broader subjects that everyone can relate to, but on this one, it’s much more personal. This is why we wanted to steer towards the <strong>UNCONQUERED<\/strong>, the beast is back; if you’ve followed <strong>KATAKLYSM a<\/strong>ll your life, there’s not one song you can’t attach to the catalogue; you have all those things on this record, but you also have the modernization of sound, the modernization of work ethic.<\/em>”<\/p>\r\n<p>Not many bands have achieved what <strong>KATAKLYSM<\/strong> has in the span of their long and rigorous career, but what truly makes them stand them apart from the masses is seeing the world through truthful eyes, and creating the perfect musical landscape to describe it. With this new album, <strong>&nbsp;KATAKLYSM<\/strong>comes swinging at life with hope, and renewed energy even amidst the world’s current, chaotic state. These things combined with<strong> KATAKLYSM<\/strong>’s relentless and organic ability to create, are the roots of what has bestowed <strong><em>UNCONQUERED<\/em><\/strong> upon us.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/kataklysm\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PTbp1LoCbNo","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"kataklysm2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/kataklysm2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27185}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1966,"uri":"https:\/\/www.kataklysm.ca\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1967,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kataklysm\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":1968,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kataklysmband\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":1969,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kataklysmband"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":1970,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCnhmvAOag0Zo9sLD2Z6Ftig"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"5akcoD7tDHbQMQXEbyxD1U","spotifyartist":"7kozeGeawfP7IEEL6dddrM","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/f\/2\/csm_kataklysm2023_1582a86333.jpg","uid":698}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Kanada","uid":36}],"pathSegment":"kataklysm","title":"Kataklysm","uid":539}],"end":"1691251200","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691247600","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1042},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"possessed","pid":176,"title":"Possessed","uid":597},"biography":"<p>There was a time in which genuine power was felt erupting from the sonic landscape that is now referred to as “old school” death metal. As with most newly developed forms of art, at its genesis it was filled with a fresh and vibrant energy and was virtually unsaturated by musicians. It was the mighty <strong>POSSESSED<\/strong> who initially breathed life into this new and exciting genre. With writing that started in 1982, the first official death metal band created the now classic record <strong>»Seven Churches«<\/strong> and established the face of the genre permanently. Even <strong>DEATH<\/strong>’s late guitarist and mastermind <strong>Chuck Schuldiner<\/strong> who is sometimes credited with creating the genre, was adamant about the album’s influence upon him. Sadly, like with many artistic pioneers, it was very early on in <strong>POSSESSED<\/strong>’s existence that a grand tragedy struck which would put the band on hiatus for almost two decades. After many years of healing, education, renewal, and eventually new writing, there is now a resurgence of life, and the rebuilt, and polished <strong>POSSESSED<\/strong> are due to return with their long awaited album <strong>»Revelations Of Oblivion«<\/strong> this Spring, 2019.<\/p>\r\n<p>As time has passed the line-up for the band has shifted and after tireless striving for perfection, the ultimate combination has been settled upon. <strong>POSSESSED<\/strong> is now original founder and song writer <strong>Jeff Becerra<\/strong> (Vocals), <strong>Daniel Gonzalez <\/strong>on guitar (Nailshitter, Gruesome), <strong>Claudeous Creamer<\/strong> on guitars (Dragonlord, Serpent, Girth), &nbsp;<strong>Robert Cardenas<\/strong> on bass guitar (Coffin Texts, Masters of Metal, Agent Steel, Malice, Engrave), and <strong>Emilio Marquez <\/strong>(Brainstorm, Sadistic Intent, Engrave, Brujeria) on drums. With the majority of the album written by founder <strong>Jeff Becerra<\/strong> and his partner in crime Guitarist <strong>Daniel Gonzalez<\/strong>, the new tracks manage to hang on to what all metal-heads hope for with their favorite artists; a consistent sound. It is a guarantee that fans will know immediately upon listening to <strong>»Revelations Of Oblivion«<\/strong> that this is in fact, the familiar sound of <strong>POSSESSED<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>The album is adorned with artwork by Polish artist <strong>Zbigniew Bielak<\/strong> who has created artwork for bands like <strong>ABSU, DEICIDE, GHOST, GORGUTS, PARADISE LOST<\/strong>, and the like. The painting on the cover radiates a complex, demonic, hellfire ridden feel. With elements of the actual lyrics strewn throughout, the image tells a very detailed story. Symbolic and abstract images of cathedrals, horrifying demons, and gothic stained glass windows are detailed magnificently. Though we’ve seen enlightened transformations throughout humanity over the past several decades, there still remains a hovering horror that can be found inside most standardized religions; often appearing to preach love and modesty, though many believe they actually demand a sort of violence and lust for power that will one day be the undoing of humanity as we know it. It is with this artwork and the underlying message of the lyrics that <strong>POSSESSED<\/strong> hope to bring back the notion of true fear that was once associated with the idea of evil.<\/p>\r\n<p>Tracks like <strong>‘No More Room In Hell’ <\/strong>describe a hell on earth where there is no more physical God, Satan, or afterlife to discern right from wrong, only the leftovers of humanity existing in torture and plague. <strong>‘The Word’<\/strong> goes more in depth concerning the less tangible ideals of a religious fallout such as the loss of scripture, and how humanity reacts when there is no longer a “word” of God to bestow boundaries upon them. Songs like <strong>‘Ritual’<\/strong> and ‘<strong>Graven’<\/strong> focus on more specific notions of hatred, religion, and what it means to engulf oneself within these things.<\/p>\r\n<p>Co-produced by <strong>Daniel Gonzalez<\/strong> and executive produced by <strong>Jeff Becerra,<\/strong> the album was recorded at NRG studios, Titan Studios, and mixed &amp; mastered by the likes of <strong>Peter <\/strong><strong>Tägtgren<\/strong> (<strong>HYPOCRISY, PAIN, BLOODBATH<\/strong>) at Abyss studios in Sweden. <strong>Becerra<\/strong> comments: <em>“Working with Peter was a fantastic experience. We put a great deal of thought into who we wanted to produce our new album. Since we hadn't made an all-new material release in well over 30 years, it was essential that we found the right person. Peter's name kept coming up over and over, and after speaking with my bandmates they all really liked Peter as he is more organic, and somebody we felt would fit in well with our process.” <\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Summertime and festival season are right around the corner, ushering in new opportunity for live shows and tour cycles for the band. With exciting announcements drawing near, <strong>POSSESSED<\/strong> is ready to take on the road. Crawling out of a pale inferno of creation, life, loss, and injury, the ensemble has returned to reignite the flame of true Death Metal.

BEARTOOTH music is an outright refusal to suffer in silence, weaponizing radio-ready bombast to deliver raw emotion mixed with noise-rock chaos. They combine hard rock and hardcore in a way that’s smart, lean, melodic, and irresistible, without apology. After over 900 million streams from songs like “The Past is Dead,” “Fed Up,” and “In Between”, in addition to the band’s fourth album, Below, topping charts and finding its way into Best Rock\/Metal Albums of the Year in 2021, Rolling Stone introduced BEARTOOTH as one of 10 New Artists You Need To Know. The 2013 Sick EP was an emotionally stranded Shomo’s “message in a bottle,” tossed into a figurative ocean. Disgusting (2014), Aggressive (2016), Disease (2018), and Below (2021) expanded those themes of desperation, each sonically getting a step closer to the magical balance between the blood, sweat, and tears of classic recordings and the smooth gloss of modern production. Their latest single “Riptide” is the culmination of that battle: a furiously courageous song of self-empowerment serving as a victory lap to memorialize a struggle with mental health and self-acceptance, which has defined so much of BEARTOOTH since its inception. BEARTOOTH offers no cure, but the recovery comes in the process; the journey is the destination. So, enjoy the ride.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/beartooth\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zv3t0Fvgvik","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"beartooth-2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/beartooth-2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27091}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":1939,"uri":"https:\/\/beartoothband.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1940,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BEARTOOTHband"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":1941,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/beartoothband\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":1942,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/beartoothband"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":1943,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/BEARTOOTHband"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"6vwjIs0tbIiseJMR3pqwiL","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/0\/3\/csm_beartooth-2023_3767b3e66e.jpg","uid":689}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika","uid":220}],"pathSegment":"beartooth","title":"Beartooth","uid":533}],"end":"1691271900","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1024","subtitle":"","title":"Louder","uid":6},"start":"1691267400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1045},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"black-mirrors","pid":176,"title":"Black Mirrors","uid":586},"biography":"<p>Tomorrow belongs to Belgian Grunge Rock sensation BLACK MIRRORS!<br \/> Female-fronted Grunge rockers BLACK MIRRORS are comparable to bands like Idles, Queens Of The Stone Age, Courtney Love, Rival Sons, Nirvana, The Distillers or The Kills,… In their message, BLACK MIRRORS share some of Rage Against The Machine’s raw energy and critical perception of the world.

In their own words<em> “It felt like we were back at the beginning again, a total reset’.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>Says singer Cormac Neeson “<em>We’ve been through a lot as a band, we’ve toured the world, made six great records we’re all proud of, given our live shows everything always and done our best to make honest and timeless music that connects with rock fans and music fans in general.

Whilst that wasn’t an easy decision, with retrospect it possibly he best decision we’ve ever made because the end result is the album we’ve been waiting to make our whole lives…full of good time rock n roll and positive energy created by four brothers who quite frankly just really missed each other.

This overwhelming journey through<br \/> progressive heaviness and searing emotionality is repeatedly accented by sonic melancholy and<br \/> gripping lyrics – leaving the listener speechless and re-cementing the Swedish five-piece at the top of<br \/> the scene without a shadow of a doubt!<br \/> Celebrating over 25 years of metal mastery, EVERGREY, led by founder, singer and guitarist Tom S.<br \/> Englund, are known for wandering the realms of progressive and heavy melodic metal and painting<br \/> sonic renderings with their twelve studio records released as of today. Now, the follow-up to the<br \/> unit’s highly successful 2021 full-length, Escape of the Phoenix (which landed at numerous chart<br \/> positions worldwide), reveals a 10 track mélange of which every note, every riff and every word<br \/> seeps pure poetry – creating a ceaseless intensity that mesmerizes from the very first second. A<br \/> Heartless Portrait (The Orphean Testament) impresses with flawless, meticulous production that<br \/> deftly depicts both heartfelt honesty and scorching metallic intensity, while its instrumental force of<br \/> furious, technically driven riffs, skyrocketing solos and dramatic synths merges with the expert,<br \/> brooding vocal performance of Englund – one of the most distinctive vocalists in metal. He skillfully<br \/> balances harsh and heavy tones with an inarguably soulful approach, all topped by melancholic,<br \/> thought-provoking lyricism that digs deeper with every spin, leaving a long-lasting impact. Pounding<br \/> opener “Save Us” reflects everything the album stands for, as it kicks in immediately with stunning<br \/> guitar work and unveils a chorus sure to top the annals of EVERGREY history! To spice things up even<br \/> more, EVERGREY invited their fans to join them on this special track and recorded hundreds of voices<br \/> that ended up on the final result. Songs like “Midwinter Calls”, which also contains fan participation<br \/> with atmospheric audience recordings from the band’s latest tour through Sweden, and “The Great<br \/> Unwashed” draw the listener in with grooving, glistering instrumentation, flowing between<br \/> boisterous dynamics and a next level vocal performance, while emotive “Wildfires” turns the volume<br \/> down as a goosebump-worthy ballad that hurts and heals all at once. “Call Out The Dark” begins<br \/> atmospherically with accented keys, suddenly evolving into an intense opus of symphonic and power<br \/> metal attributes in the blink of an eye, whereas the record’s longest track, “The Orphean Testament”,<br \/> impresses by revealing its heaviest facet. A sensitive introduction lures the listener into “Heartless”,<br \/> and offers one of the album’s most engaging verses, followed by a hauntingly beautiful chorus and<br \/> variety in pace to create a magnificent listening experience.<br \/> A Heartless Portrait (The Orphean Testament) is a striking testament to the fact that while the<br \/> Swedish five-piece doesn’t need to prove anything to anyone at this phase, they still impressively<br \/> showcase that, after over 25 years of existence, their creativity sees no bounds – dropping yet<br \/> another sensation within their impressive catalog!<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/evergrey\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RBAQO8Oao3w","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"evergrey_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/evergrey_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27378}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2141,"uri":"http:\/\/www.evergrey.net"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2142,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Evergrey\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2143,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/evergreyofficial\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2144,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCujgv2Lm1wJqO6PPJHNOSFQ"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"4S0foX2r0RlC12KBW8u73D","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/8\/a\/csm_evergrey_2023_e4536d00f2.jpg","uid":740}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Schweden","uid":186}],"pathSegment":"evergrey","title":"Evergrey","uid":94}],"end":"1691262000","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1408","subtitle":"","title":"Headbangers Stage","uid":7},"start":"1691258400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1057},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"der-w","pid":176,"title":"Der W","uid":591},"biography":"<p><br \/> Stephan Weidner kehrte 2022 aus dem Stadion zurück in die Clubs des Landes: Mit DER W feiert der Bassist und Texter der megaerfolgreichen Böhsen Onkelz den emotionalen Schulterschluss aus nächster Nähe.

Slamming together disparate musical styles ranging from death and black metal to breakcore, Balkan, baroque and<br \/> classical music in a manner that is as unconventional and unpredictable as it is thrilling, Igorrr are unlike any other act, and Spirituality And Distortion displays just as broad a range of emotions as sounds. \"Getting stuck in only one emotion is very boring to me; life is a wide range of emotions -<br \/> sometimes you're happy, sometimes you're sad, angry, pissed off, nostalgic or blown away,\" states mastermind Gautier Serre. \"Life is not only one color. These 14 tracks are a journey through different states of mind I've been through.\"<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> Admitting that upon starting work on the record he lacked confidence in realizing it - \"I was not sure at all of what I was doing, where it was gonna lead, or if I would be able to make an albumwith it or not, I was just following my instinct and seeing where it might reach\" - one influence<br \/> pushed through and is a prominent part of Spirituality And Distortion: traditional eastern music.<br \/> \"No idea where it comes from, but the colors of those sounds inspired me a lot. It's something I've been extremely attracted to. Those sounds have a real deepness in the emotional range, and combined with heavy music, it's something which took me very deep into myself, and which pushed<br \/> me into doing tracks like 'Downgrade Desert', 'Camel Dancefloor', 'Himalaya Massive Ritual' or 'Overweight Poesy'.\" At no stage was there any plan, embracing the freedom offered in the wake of<br \/> achieving Savage Sinusoid and going wherever ideas took him, embracing a small army of specialist musicians to help him attain his vision. Importantly, like its predecessor, this is not a predominantly electronic record. \"The organization part has been more complicated as we had to<br \/> fly traditional instrumentalists to our studio, so, lots of planes, trains and cars were involved to make it happen, but all the acoustic instruments have been recorded traditionally, with no help of the computer.\" These included violinist Timba Harris, bassist Mike Leon, pianist Matt Lebofsky,<br \/> Oud player Mehdi Haddab, accordion player Pierre Mussi, Kanoun player Fotini Kokkala and harpsichordist Benjamin Bardiaux, among others. Vocally, the most prominent performer is Laure<br \/> Le Prunenec, whose operatic strains are a longtime part of the Igorrr mix, while regular collaborator Laurent Lunoir also appears on a few tracks. Serre also invited Pierre Lacasa and<br \/> Jasmine Barra of Vegetable Soup and Cheval to appear on \"Kung-Fu Chèvre\" and got to realize a dream with one guest performer. \"We had the honor to welcome my personal favorite musical hero on this album: George 'Corpsegrinder' Fisher of Cannibal Corpse. He screams on the track<br \/> 'Parpaing', and his legendary voice brings the heaviness this track deserved. George is like the final boss of death metal. Like on a video game you have the final boss who is the strongest, George is the best in death metal singing. Due to the extreme heaviness and violence of his voice, I found it<br \/> very much coherent to contrast it with a cheap tune of 8bit music which is the least heavy music on earth. The contrast is beautiful to my ears.\" However, lyrics are less important when he is creating, and often these are delivered in languages he does not even speak. \"As with the previous albums,<br \/> I'm entirely focused on the sound itself and how the sonorities of the voice speaks to the heart, not the intellectual meaning of the words.\"<\/p>\r\n<p>Ever unconventional, the title for the record came from circumstances most musicians would never experience. \"At the beginning, I chose to call one of the tracks 'Spirituality And Distortion' as on<br \/> this track there were deep oriental sounds with heavy distorted guitars that I made by putting fire on the cabs of my amplifier. Doing that, I found the perfect split between the spirituality and the<br \/> distortion, which are two perfectly opposite concepts, and later on, I noticed that it was the case with not only one, but many tracks of the album - the heavy distortion due to the settings and the<br \/> actual fire, and the spiritual mood that the middle eastern instruments were giving to the soul. This title represents pretty well the split between two opposite feelings, and that is the same feeling you<br \/> have after you listen to the album.\" Tracked at Improve Tone Studios in France, Serre employed the same technical crew as on Savage Sinusoid but chose again to work with no outside producers,<br \/> uncomfortable with giving his \"baby\" to anyone else, and 100% confident in his own abilities to achieve that which he intends once in the studio environment and surrounded by his selected<br \/> instrumentalists. He admits, however, that the sessions were very, very intensive this time around.<br \/> \"I got closed inside the studio for a very long time without having a break. The difference with 'Savage Sinusoid' is that I did the same amount of work but over a much longer period of time. The 'Spirituality And Distortion' sessions were much more intense in that I did it in a much shorter<br \/> time; it was intensive work to push myself to the hardest limits I could endure. To be honest, I suffered pretty much in the process of creating this album, and I'm very happy, despite all the difficulties - technical and human - that I succeed to not let go even the smallest bit of the quality I<br \/> wanted for this album. Also, if this new music was not better than the last record in my mind, I wouldn't release it.\"<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/igorrr\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YCqG9B8j-cI","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"igorrr_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/igorrr_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27538}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2363,"uri":"https:\/\/igorrr.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2364,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/igorrr_music\/?hl=de"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2365,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/IgorrrBarrroque\/"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"2p2uE4i92Dn4DkThfoKIB9","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/2\/d\/csm_igorrr_2023_fe628e6b93.jpg","uid":803}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Frankreich","uid":72}],"pathSegment":"igorrr","title":"Igorrr","uid":627}],"end":"1691280000","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1408","subtitle":"","title":"Headbangers Stage","uid":7},"start":"1691276400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1059},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"enemy-inside","pid":176,"title":"Enemy Inside","uid":573},"biography":"<p>Mit Enemy Inside präsentieren sich fünf junge MusikerInnen aus der Region Aschaffenburg, die 2018 mit der Veröffentlichung ihrer ersten CD „Phoenix“ einen Start nach Maß hinlegten.

An album equipped to become a modern metal classic, a work of reference for honest, true steel. It’s obvious: anyone who manages to deliver such a Witch Hammer after just one year has to have the magic touch. Black magic that is!<\/p>\r\n<p>But that’s exactly what this band have always possessed. For five years the Swiss witches have been putting their occult mark on the international metal world. Not only holding their ground in a male-dominated field, they are also initiating a desperately needed change of power. The triptych consisting of Burning Witches (2017), Hexenhammer (2018) and Dance With The Devil (2020) instantly brought them to festivals like Wacken Open Air, Summer Breeze and Rock Harz Open Air, and the battle cries of these three records are still ringing.<\/p>\r\n<p>Few bands in recent memory have established themselves as quickly as Burning Witches, and few are able to write such timeless, grand tunes with somnambulistic ease; carrying Judas Priest in their hearts without becoming overly nostalgic, whilst rapidly developing their own unique voice. “We’re not really into bigger experiments,” confesses guitarist and main songwriter Romana. “We’re all burning for classic metal like Maiden, Priest and Slayer. For me nothing’s better than this kind of music, so Burning Witches will always stay true to themselves. Whenever you come to my place for a barbecue,” she laughs, “only very rarely will you get to hear a record that wasn’t born in the eighties.”<\/p>\r\n<p>From the eighties straight to the present day -&nbsp; in 2021, the Witches opened a particularly gripping page in their grimoire: an album forged in the fires of a pandemic, created with patience, finesse and pitch-black lifeblood during a time in which even the Swiss\/Dutch coven had to retreat into the isolation and quietness of the dark woods. Right there they hatched new spells and new ways of weaving their potent magic into the world. For Freya, for the druidesses, for the witches as past, present and future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We are close friends who really like spending time together,” says Romana. “Hardly anything gives us as much joy as music does, and that’s why we create a lot of music together. Of course we also go to pubs together, but since that hasn’t been possible for a while now and we haven’t been able to play shows either, we were writing new songs instead and kept practicing more than ever.” Burning Witches made use of the lockdown in an exemplary manner to become even better musicians. “We never had this much time for new music,” says Romana. “This album was created without any pressure at all.” One thing that spurred the five of them on was the staggering response Dance With The Devil received from fans. “None of us would have dreamed of what we’ve experienced during the last five years. That lets our flame burn even brighter.”<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s nice to hear this exact same fire, this excitement crackle within the new songs. Romana (guitars), Laura (vocals), Jay (Bass) and Lala (drums) completed the band by adding new guitarist Larissa in 2020: The Witch Of The North sounds unleashed and completely rounded. We’re looking at five pure musicians that have sought and finally found each other. “Larissa wasn’t a complete stranger to us, we’ve known each other since first grade,“ the guitarist explains. “Ever since she joined we’ve been asking ourselves why it hasn’t happened a lot earlier. Now it feels like we’ve been playing together for ages. We have the feeling that all of us have finally arrived. The chemistry in Burning Witches has never been this good.” Not to mention the solo skills of the new member. Romana laughs: “We were absolutely flabbergasted by the solos she was knocking out. Truly amazing!”&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>At the end of 2020, several recording sessions with Swiss metal legend V.O. Pulver and thrash titan Schmier (Destruction) as their producer, enabled this foremost incarnation of the band to take their explosive heavy metal to new heights. “We know each other well and V.O. Pulver knows exactly what we want. He’s always pushing us to step up our game,” Romana recapitulates the multi-week recording sessions at the end of 2020. When they entered Little Creek Studio, their agenda was as simple as it was effective: “We make the music that’s inside ourselves, but we’re always adding new elements to the sound in order to keep it exciting. This time, we wanted to sound more epic, and slightly heavier, just a bit more like the type of heavy metal that we love the most. That’s all we think of.” This is why the bad-ass witches’ coven struggles with emphasizing individual songs. “We’re not a band that writes singles,” Romana firmly states. “For us it’s about the love for heavy metal, that’s all.” Sure, with “Circle of Five,” “We Stand As One“ or the title track there’s an ample amount of rousing, blistering hymns; but for Burning Witches – and you can call that old fashioned if you like – it’s the album that counts, from its intro up to the concluding cover song.<\/p>\r\n<p>Speaking of cover songs: after “Holy Diver” and “Battle Hymn” this time sees “Hall Of The Mountain King” by the mighty Savatage – including guest solos by Chris Caffery – what a choice, what a rendition! “At first we were keen on covering Saxon, because we have seen them live so many times; then at some point our singer Laura suggested the ‘Mountain King’ and this idea instantly got all of us excited.” Romana’s enthusiasm even went so far as to buy the same guitar model the late great Chriss Oliva used to record the song in 1987. The highest level of dedication. “We wanted to keep the origin of this music and of our band alive,“ the band leader comments on the traditional cover songs. “We want to honour the roots and pay tribute to the bands that shaped us. What we are now we owe to these old bands. It means a lot to us.”<\/p>\r\n<p>But Burning Witches don’t just see themselves standing in the tradition of classic, epic heavy metal bands. As the enchanted cover suggests it’s also about something else, something deeper. The album acknowledges the druidesses of Celtic history. The wise, nature-loving women whom individuals would consult, who were, however, feared and persecuted at the same time. Burning Witches see themselves continuing the tradition of these women. Because one thing is certain: this coven can’t be stopped by prejudice, nor by stakes, nor diatribes. The era of the Witches has begun. And anyone who won’t join this black magic circle will bitterly regret it for all eternity.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/burning-witches\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZYLkhMj5UXY","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"burning-witches-2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/burning-witches-2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27099}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":1955,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/burningwitches666\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":1956,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCuba8pbIQpqiM58ULyQczzw"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"0eNuNAhL4dW2nvKbSe2mS8","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/6\/c\/csm_burning-witches-2023_265ec9a077.jpg","uid":695}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Schweiz","uid":41}],"pathSegment":"burning-witches","title":"Burning Witches","uid":199}],"end":"1691243100","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1536","subtitle":"","title":"W:E:T Stage","uid":8},"start":"1691240400","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1048},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"empire-state-bastard","pid":176,"title":"Empire State Bastard","uid":619},"biography":"<p>What’s in a name? If you choose to call your band Empire State Bastard, you’re making a statement-of-intent. Namely: riff after riff after motherfucking riff, battering ram rhythms, and feral vocals which splurge from death metal growls to anguished, black-hearted howls.<\/p>\r\n<p>The band’s debut album, ‘Rivers of Heresy’, adventurously probes almost every dark crevice imaginable from the myriad sounds of metal and genre-adjacent extremity. Their terrifying tourist trail visits slamming hardcore in the vein of Siege; frenetic, visceral thrash in Slayer’s ballpark; the claustrophobic sludge of Melvins; the freeform vocal dexterity of Mike Patton; and the gargantuan stoner riffs of Sleep. Rooted in metal’s forefathers, but informed by more recent waves of leftfield aggression, Empire State Bastard are a band that can prosper at landmark metal festivals such as Download and Hellfest as well as more niche events including Roadburn and Arctangent.<\/p>\r\n<p>The story dates back to Manchester’s Night and Day Cafe in February, 2002. Empire State Bastard guitarist Mike Vennart’s band Oceansize were sharing a bill with a then unknown Biffy Clyro. From the name, Mike expected to be greeted by a “psychedelic Welsh folk band like Gorky's Zygotic Mynci” but was instead blown away by “three guys screaming their heads off with a big Marshall stack.” Instantly the two bands shared a friendship and a mutual admiration. And when Biffy went stratospheric following the success of their ‘Only Revolutions’ album, Mike joined the band as their touring guitarist and has stayed with them ever since.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mike and Biffy frontman Simon Neil would spend downtime on tour sitting at the back of the bus sharing the heaviest, most avant-garde or the most sickeningly confrontational music they could find. When thoughts turned to making their own sonic wasteland, Simon already had the band name in mind (“I always knew that if I made a really heavy record, it was gonna be called Empire State Bastard”), leaving Mike with a particularly grotesque challenge: what music could he write that would live up to the name?<\/p>\r\n<p>It took around a decade to find both the time and ferocity to make it happen. Inflamed by caustic right-wing politics and bored by generic arena metal, Mike’s rush of inspiration resulted in a tonne of song ideas. At times the concept was more defined: the full-throttle ten songs-in-ten-minutes chaos of grindcore, or the calculated mathy chaos of Converge or Dillinger Escape Plan. Instead, it reflected a shared love of what Mike calls “a spectrum of wide-ranging versions of pure sonic annihilation. I’d written songs which didn’t directly relate to each other, but I like to think they all make friends with each other.”<\/p>\r\n<p>In contrast to his work with Biffy, Simon’s contribution to the record would be almost exclusively vocals. Within the album’s first two songs, ‘Harvest’ and ‘Blusher’, his voice is more varied than ever with reference points including the shrieks and gasps you might hear on a Fantomas album to guttural death growls that echo Morbid Angel or Mayhem. “I thought of my voice as a selection of instruments that I could utilise at different points in the songs,” he explains. “I had an instinct that I needed to make everything as three-dimensional as possible. So the anger in my screaming needed to be juxtaposed with the more flippant and throwaway falsettos that you shouldn’t normally get in heavy heavy music.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Lyrically, he smiles, “it’s as misanthropic and nihilistic as I’ve ever written” united by looking at situations “where you’re not seeing eye-to-eye with the person you need to see eye-to-eye with.” The spark was the frustration of post-lockdown society. While he expected a new unity, a fresh collective spirit, the reality was very much the opposite. “It feels like the person that shouts the loudest gets listened to the most, and that’s a real sad state of affairs. If you feel bulletproof and you don’t feel shame, you plough through and take as many people out of the game and as much collateral damage as possible. That’s something I struggle with. I think most level-headed people do, but most level-headed people don’t put their head above the parapet because it’s not worth it.”<\/p>\r\n<p>While those themes dominate the record - targeting pig-headed ignorance in ‘Moi’, the erosion of shame in ‘Blusher’ or imagining a society beyond salvation in ‘Dusty’, there are also moments with the jet black humour of Takashi Miike. ‘Palm of Hands’, for example, provides a vignette of “going to a sex party and it going horrifically wrong.”<\/p>\r\n<p>Underpinning the duo’s visceral attack is an equally frenetic drum performance. Akin to a runaway train just about staying on the tracks, the propulsive rush of manic fills and fleet-footed double-kicks pulverises and grooves in equal measure. Mike had programmed the initial drums, but the pair were stuck on a dilemma - who did they know who could play like Slayer legend Dave Lombardo? Simon’s solution? “Let’s just ask Dave fucking Lombardo!”<\/p>\r\n<p>In a culmination of the pair’s teenage metal fantasies, he quickly accepted, and submitted his parts after a fortnight of sessions. “It felt like we were sitting in the room listening to Dave play for us,” says Simon, a wide-eyed sense of wonder still gleaming in his eyes. “To have the guy that basically invented modern metal drumming playing on our record made it a success in that moment.”<\/p>\r\n<p>His contributions are especially fascinating on ‘Tired, Aye’, which saw Simon cut out the guitars and bass to create a vocal \/ drum assault in the realm of John Zorn’s Naked City. “There’s something so primal about that song,” laughs Simon at its sheer audacity. “It’s basically a duet. We’re like Kiki Dee and Elton John, except it’s Simon Neil and Dave Lombardo. It’s our version of ‘Don’t Go Breaking My Heart’.”<\/p>\r\n<p>The excitement they share for having Dave Lombardo involved is symptomatic of their pure intentions behind Empire State Bastard. Metal is what inspired them to first play music - Maiden, Metallica, Sabbath, Pantera - and while they’re at a time in their lives when rock bands are more likely to want to discover their inner Neil Young, instead they’ve made a record that purges every type of heaviness imaginable. Throughout this conversation, they reference all manner of essential aggressive artists, also taking in The Locust, Oranssi Pazuzu, Daughters, Godflesh, Max Cavalera, High On Fire, Will Haven, The Armed, Brutus and Deafheaven. In short, they’re fans. Just like you or I.<\/p>\r\n<p>As Simon affirms, “Walking downtown as a teenager wearing a Sepultura ‘Chaos AD’ t-shirt, combat trousers and Doc Martens, people would stop and stare. That’s what makes us feel part of something and why I’ve always cared so much about rock and heavy music. We got into this music to be 1 person in a 100, rather than be part of the 99. It’s great to channel that fucking rage, that no-one else gets this but we do.”<\/p>\r\n<p>That ethos stretches to Empire State Bastard. It’s not a time-killer between Biffy records. It’s the product of a compulsion to create a sound that’s been a vital inspiration for both men for 30+ years. They’re taking it seriously. Dave Lombardo is committed to playing as many shows as his schedule allows (the live band being completed by former Bitch Falcon bassist Naomi Macleod) and a second record is already in the works.<\/p>\r\n<p>So what’s in a name? Simon coined it, but Mike really defined it: “I set about making the most fucking poisonous vile music I possibly could, just unabridged hatred in musical form.” <em>That’s<\/em> Empire State Bastard.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/empire-state-bastard\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fj84W-9YUlA","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":true,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"empire_state_bastard_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/empire_state_bastard_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27529}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":true,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2333,"uri":"https:\/\/empirestatebastard.com\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2334,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/empirestatebastard\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2335,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/esb666_\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2336,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/esb666_"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2337,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCcPQHfJR-4pErdONBUpQDbg"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"4Lje5EOojiMe1qsGspOlDq","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/6\/9\/csm_empire_state_bastard_2023_089a680a7b.jpg","uid":794}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Großbritannien","uid":74}],"pathSegment":"empire-state-bastard","title":"Empire State Bastard","uid":619}],"end":"1691250300","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1536","subtitle":"","title":"W:E:T Stage","uid":8},"start":"1691247600","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1049},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"nestor","pid":176,"title":"Nestor","uid":547},"biography":"<p><strong><em>NESTOR<\/em><\/strong><em>&nbsp;are five childhood friends who formed a band over three decades ago in their hometown of Falköping, Sweden.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><em>Now the rockstar dreams of their youth have been revitalised and once again the band&nbsp;embraces influences from the 80s with tongues-in-cheek and a lot of heart.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><em>With three previously released singles this year and over a million plays combined for the songs and music videos, the hype is enormous for the album&nbsp;<strong>“Kids In A Ghost Town”<\/strong>&nbsp;from Swedish nostalgic rock band&nbsp;<strong>NESTOR<\/strong>, that was released on&nbsp;<strong>October 22nd<\/strong>.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><em>The before mentioned singles “On The Run”, “1989” and latest single “Tomorrow” (featuring none other than 80s pop icon&nbsp;<strong>Samantha Fox<\/strong>) are accompanied on the album with seven more tracks, all of them equally worthy of recognition.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><em>There are certainly no fillers on this AOR milestone in the making -

Even fewer are those that continue to reach new creative heights, long after legendary status has been achieved. Voïvod were never like other bands: even as the thrash metal scene exploded in the early ‘80s, the Jonquière, Québec crew stood apart, both as unique visionaries and as proud subverters of the metallic norm. From early prog-thrash classics like Killing Technology and Dimension Hatröss through to the psychedelic explorations of The Outer Limits, Voïvod have been standard bearers for individuality and creative freedom for nearly 40 years.<\/p>\r\n<p>Always defiantly out of step with prevailing trends but widely respected as true mavericks, Voïvod even weathered the untimely death of talismanic guitarist and songwriter Denis ‘Piggy’ D’Amour in 2005. Buoyed by the support of their huge global following, surviving original members Denis “Snake” Bélanger (vocals), Michel “Away” Langevin (drums) and Jean-Yves “Blacky” Thériault embarked on a new and challenging chapter in the Voïvod story, releasing the much-hailed Target Earth in 2013, with guitarist Daniel “Chewy” Mongrain proving himself to be a smart and dextrous successor to D’Amour.<\/p>\r\n<p>By 2014, bassist Dominic “Rocky” Laroche had replaced Thériault, and a new incarnation of this indestructible band crossed their compositional beams to forge yet more mind-bending, psychedelic post-thrash wizardry.

One of the band’s most successful albums yet, The Wake scored chart entries in Germany (#26), Switzerland (#51), Belgium (Wallonia) (#94) and the USA (New Artist: #8\/Overall: #148): confirmation that the band’s return to peak form had struck a chord with fans old and new. Not surprisingly, Voïvod hit the road to reaffirm their status as one of metal’s most unique and powerful live acts.<\/p>\r\n<p>“At first we went on tour for almost two years, pretty intensively, with great bands and line-ups,” recalls Chewy. “We went all over the globe, to Australia, Japan and Europe many times, and twice across North America. It was great! We had also a few surprising invitations, like playing the Montreal Jazz Fest. We also won a Juno award for ‘Metal\/Hard Music Album’ of 2019. We came back home in late December 2019, and then everything stopped for obvious reasons.”<br \/> Confined to their quarters for those long months of lockdown, Canada’s finest simply did what they do best: create. The result is Synchro Anarchy, Voïvod’s 15th studio album and, as fans have come to expect, yet another unparalleled eruption of wildly imaginative heaviness. Shaped by the weirdest of circumstances, the new songs were born from an intense period of collaboration.<\/p>\r\n<p>“It was a challenge, because we couldn’t jam together very much, but we all welcomed the circumstances as a new creative element,” says Chewy. “Lots of demos and files were shared and it was all worked to the point where it really sounded like the four of us playing in the same room. We could get together and try the ideas out just before the recording process to make all the small adjustments. In the end, it was almost like a race against the clock. It was pretty intense, but we welcomed the challenge!”<\/p>\r\n<p>Despite the pressures of working amid a global pandemic, Synchro Anarchy sounds like the work of truly liberated artists. Following the career peak of The Wake was always going to be tricky, but the Canadians have smashed the follow-up out of the park, delivering one of the most idiosyncratic and adventurous expressions of their unique, genre-bending sound yet. Fans old and new can expect something truly mind-blowing this time around.<br \/> “I think it’s pure Voïvod!” says Chewy. “I think it's a dark record with glimpses of light. It’s intricate, and deep. There’s complexity. There are new explorations on many levels. Of course, there are many references to space, to the advance of technology versus our fragile planet, to mental illness, anxiety, rebellion, fatality, time and space mysteries. Synchronicity and chaos! Lots of food for thought, I suppose. And the tones are fantastic. Francis (Perron, producer) worked his magic at RadicArt Studio. He has been part of the Voïvod sound since our Post Society EP.”<br \/> Still one of the most fervently creative bands on the planet, Voïvod have created another kaleidoscopic sonic monster. The perfect antidote to just about everything, Synchro Anarchy will light up 2022 with crazed, lysergic glee. Meanwhile, its creators are planning their next around-the-world campaign, armed with some of the finest music they have ever written.<\/p>\r\n<p>“We can’t wait to put out the album and go on tour, as soon as it’s possible and safe!” concludes Chewy. “Many things are on the way for Voïvod, we have a documentary and a book, and we may do some more online performances… we’ll see! But there are a lot of options. We all miss the touring and meeting our friends and fans around the world. That’s what it’s all about: creating, travelling, connecting with people.”<br \/> &nbsp;<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/voivod\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hryt9k8Zql8","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"voivod_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/voivod_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27442}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2269,"uri":"https:\/\/www.voivodmerch.com "},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2270,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Voivod"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2271,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/voivodofficial "},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2272,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/voivoddotnet"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"0lFiKrJUofJpnrAJnMsnQ3","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/1\/3\/csm_voivod_2023_7d720e233f.jpg","uid":774}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Kanada","uid":36}],"pathSegment":"voivod","title":"Voivod","uid":603}],"end":"1691266500","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"1536","subtitle":"","title":"W:E:T Stage","uid":8},"start":"1691262900","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1051},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"sleep-token","pid":176,"title":"Sleep Token","uid":599},"biography":"<p>Beneath the Sleep Token banner, lies the unique, broad-based vision of one individual – anonymous, silent, masked, armed with a staggering vocal range, a deft touch on the keyboards, plus a live approach that is never less than fully engaged.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The UK underground entity only known as Sleep Token, fronted by Vessel, started the ‘Sundowning’ ritual on June 20<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;2019&nbsp;with ‘The Night Does Not Belong To God’.

Altor","uid":620},"biography":"<p>The founders Mats and Ragnar grew up with Bathory’s epic era in their hearts, so it comes as no surprise that their music would somewhat flaunt the influence of their house god Quorthon. So with Bathory’s anthems as their spiritual foundation, they set out to find their creative and unique niche within the epic Viking metal genre.<\/p>\r\n<p>It all begun 2003 when Mats and Ragnar heeded the call of the one-eyed elder to begin their epic journey and since then they have released fullength albums through I Hate Records, Napalm Records and Cyclone Empire. Each and every release that has been unleashed to the masses has carried the legacy of pure Scandinavian Epic Metal from the heart. During these years Ereb Altor has developed their own unique sound within the Viking Metal genre and the ever increasing fan base is thriving.<\/p>\r\n<p>In april 2015 the latest Ereb Altor album “Nattramn” saw the light of day. An album that continues on the path set out by the predecessor ”fire meets ice” with the more epic side, with huge atmospheres built by echoing choirs from the snow covered mountains which at times are shred apart by fierce and aggressive parts with screams from the darkest forests of Scandinavia creating a dynamic and varied piece of art. The lyrics in the world of Ereb Altor always connects to the inheritance of Scandinavia and Ereb Altor is telling stories from the Norse mythology as well as dark legends that have been told from man to man centuries ago in Sweden.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 2016 Ereb Altor paid tribute to the late grand master Quorthon. Seven Bathory songs were recorded and released on vinyl. The release were praised by media and by the fans. The words ”the true heirs of Quorthon” was mentioned several times.<\/p>\r\n<p>The next chapter of the Ereb Altor saga is about to begin with a new album in 2017 and a new label. Ereb Altor will join forces with Hammerheart to spread the Scandinavian darkness once again. This time Ereb Altor will use their mother language on several songs and seamlessly unite Black Metal with Epic Viking hymns.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the first years Ereb Altor only made live appearances at festivals around Europe but since drummer Tord joined theband in 2012 and Bassist Mikael in 2013 Ereb Altor has become a touring band and have toured with bands like Borknagar &amp; Månegarm. Now Ereb Altor has made it to the bigger festivals like Wacken, Hellfest and Summer Breeze &amp; Ereb Altor will also set sail and travel over the Atlantic Ocean for the first time 2017.<\/p>\r\n<p>The rumour is growing of this fantastic live act where the audience will be drawn in to the atmosphere Ereb Altor is building with all the choirs and a massive wall of sound.

The sister of Arthur and mistress of the lost souls has joined the four kings on the fourth chapter of the WARKINGS saga, Morgana, to be unleashed on November 11, 2022 via Napalm Records! Forging their musical steel in the tradition of Powerwolf, Sabaton, HammerFall and Running Wild, the WARKINGS burst onto the battlefields in 2018. They gathered their Warriors around the world and entered the Official German Album Charts 2021 at #13 with Revolution. Gathered in the golden halls of Valhalla, the four ancient kings – a roman Tribune, a wild Viking, a noble Crusader and a martial Spartan – are now back with Morgana, having already escaped from the underworld, fought the Monarchs of the dusk and called for Revolution.<br \/> Back in the realms of the dead, they were captivated by the eerie and extraordinary chanting voice of “evil” sorceress Morgana La Fey. Obsessed with the idea of telling humanity her own version of her story, the witch inspired the WARKINGS to include Morgana in their circle as they fought their next battles – a covenant made for eternity!<br \/> In their trademark manner, the WARKINGS – armed with weapons made of pure Heavy Metal – tell their stories in songs forged of pure steel. Morgana's haunting voice rises to tell her story in four acts: The first chapter \"Hellfire\", tells of her love-hate relationship with King Arthur, \"Monsters\" of the dark side in each of us, and \"Heart of Rage\" of her desire to grant forgiveness to all who have hurt her, before revealing in \"Immortal\" how she and Arthur's immortal souls are reborn again and again. In the last two chapters of the battle, Arthur himself speaks out and implores Morgana not to give up, before he himself narrates the Arthurian saga in the crowning finale! Of course, the WARKINGS themselves raise their voices to tell their stories – recounting their battles with Hereward the Wake, the naval battle of Salamis and a man unjustly enslaved. As a special gift, the WARKINGS offer “To The King” – a hymn in honor of the most loyal of the faithful WARKINGS Warriors, who stand side by side with the mighty kings in all battles!<br \/> Raise your swords and join the next fight in the WARKINGS saga with Morgana!<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/warkings\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j0n-aSinVbU","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"warkings_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/warkings_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27270}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2071,"uri":"httpa:\/\/warkings.rocks\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2072,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/warkingsmetal\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2073,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/warkings_metal\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2074,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/warkings_metal"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"7DXUeaMULtMVFmmaKFzH3E","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/7\/9\/csm_warkings_2023_4443539641.jpg","uid":724}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Norwegen","uid":158}],"pathSegment":"warkings","title":"Warkings","uid":110}],"end":"1691262900","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2304","subtitle":"","title":"Wackinger Stage","uid":10},"start":"1691259300","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1065},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"mr-hurley-und-die-pulveraffen","pid":176,"title":"Mr. Hurley und die Pulveraffen","uid":630},"biography":"<p>Mitglieder:<\/p>\r\n<p>Mr. Hurley (Simon Erichsen): Gitarre, Gesang<\/p>\r\n<p>Buckteeth Bannock (Christoph Erichsen): Akkordeon, Klavier, Gesang<\/p>\r\n<p>Pegleg Peggy (Esther Erichsen): Bass, Gesang<\/p>\r\n<p>Der einäugige Morgan (Johannes Erichsen): Schlagwerk, Percussion, Gesang<\/p>\r\n<p>Die Bandmitglieder sind Geschwister.

It’s all drenched in the countercultural, mind-smashing, gut-punching bile of likeminded spiritual shamans like Acid Bath and Eyehategod, with the down-tuned sludge of stoner rock, and an electric injection from four-on-the-floor classic rock pioneers.<\/p>\r\n<p>ALL HAIL THE YETI summons a primal underground spirit shared in communion with horror convention attendees, metal festival-goers, and outlaws of all stripes. The Hollywood, California storytellers have their boots firmly planted in the cinematic anarchy of the modern exploitation masters, who bucked the studio systems, and their fingers scratching and clawing into the underbelly of Americana.<\/p>\r\n<p>As mysterious as the thought-provoking handmade monuments that dot lonely roads, as fearsome yet enticing as the forks that beckon travelers to choose their next adventure, ALL HAIL THE YETI’s third album is a meditative road trip to the brain. Highway Crosses is a defining work of haunted power, filled with songs that traverse treacherous musical mountains with animalistic urgency and focused rage.<\/p>\r\n<p>Assembled with the obsessive DIY concentration of Freddy Krueger’s bladed glove or a batch of moonshine, ALL HAIL THE YETI made their mark in clubs and theaters a decade ago, until the larger international metal community could no longer ignore them. Songs like “The Art of Mourning,” “Suicide Woods,” and “Daughter of the Morning Star” are anthems for road-tripping vagabonds and cubicle crushing drones alike, touching a nerve with those who brave (or dream about) a life outside the box.<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s a style of music and approach to songwriting and performance that has made ALL HAIL THE YETI equally at home in front of diverse crowds, sharing touring bills in the United States and Europe with bands like In This Moment, Motionless In White, Max &amp; Iggor Cavalera, Hollywood Undead, 36 Crazy Fists, and Life Of Agony.<\/p>\r\n<p>Minus HEAD Records proudly reissued the band’s self-titled debut, followed by the incredibly well received Screams from a Black Wilderness(2016), an anthology of original campfire tales comprising a creepy but nonetheless inviting sonic wilderness, produced by heavy tastemaker Matt Hyde (Slayer, Deftones, Hatebreed).<\/p>\r\n<p>Highway Crosses was made in collaboration with versatile Grammy-winning producer Warren Riker (Lauryn Hill, Santana, Michael Jackson), best known by metalheads for his work on the second and third albums by New Orleans supergroup DOWN and heavy slabs from Crowbar, Cynic, and the UK’s Cathedral. Songs like “Slow Season,” “Highway Crosses,” and “Felo De Se” mine the strengths of All Hail The Yeti’s already impressive catalog, with fresh vibrancy and raw ambition.<\/p>\r\n<p>“Slow Season” is a product of two different songs conceived for the album that were merged together, a lyrical contemplation about sanity and survival, when one finds themselves stranded alone. “Highway Crosses,” which like “Felo De Se” was co-written with Jorel Decker of Hollywood Undead, bucks All Hail The Yeti’s often unconventional structures for a more stripped-down almost Mötley Crüe style approach. Lyrically it’s the tale of a murderous lycanthrope that’s part An American Werewolf in London, part The Hitcher. Album closer “Nuclear Dust” is a continuation of sorts of “Nemesis Queen,” from the previous album, as 200-ft. tall killing machine monsters rule Earth.<\/p>\r\n<p>Heavy music adherents weaned on anything from Metallica and Pantera to metalcore, Southern groove, black metal, or stoner grind will find a home among the All Hail The Yeti faithful. Film fanatics who worship Stanley Kubrick and John Carpenter have reasons to celebrate Highway Crosses as well, as the songs are fashioned with similar analog angst and obsessive craftsmanship.

It’s all drenched in the countercultural, mind-smashing, gut-punching bile of likeminded spiritual shamans like Acid Bath and Eyehategod, with the down-tuned sludge of stoner rock, and an electric injection from four-on-the-floor classic rock pioneers.<\/p>\r\n<p>ALL HAIL THE YETI summons a primal underground spirit shared in communion with horror convention attendees, metal festival-goers, and outlaws of all stripes. The Hollywood, California storytellers have their boots firmly planted in the cinematic anarchy of the modern exploitation masters, who bucked the studio systems, and their fingers scratching and clawing into the underbelly of Americana.<\/p>\r\n<p>As mysterious as the thought-provoking handmade monuments that dot lonely roads, as fearsome yet enticing as the forks that beckon travelers to choose their next adventure, ALL HAIL THE YETI’s third album is a meditative road trip to the brain. Highway Crosses is a defining work of haunted power, filled with songs that traverse treacherous musical mountains with animalistic urgency and focused rage.<\/p>\r\n<p>Assembled with the obsessive DIY concentration of Freddy Krueger’s bladed glove or a batch of moonshine, ALL HAIL THE YETI made their mark in clubs and theaters a decade ago, until the larger international metal community could no longer ignore them. Songs like “The Art of Mourning,” “Suicide Woods,” and “Daughter of the Morning Star” are anthems for road-tripping vagabonds and cubicle crushing drones alike, touching a nerve with those who brave (or dream about) a life outside the box.<\/p>\r\n<p>It’s a style of music and approach to songwriting and performance that has made ALL HAIL THE YETI equally at home in front of diverse crowds, sharing touring bills in the United States and Europe with bands like In This Moment, Motionless In White, Max &amp; Iggor Cavalera, Hollywood Undead, 36 Crazy Fists, and Life Of Agony.<\/p>\r\n<p>Minus HEAD Records proudly reissued the band’s self-titled debut, followed by the incredibly well received Screams from a Black Wilderness(2016), an anthology of original campfire tales comprising a creepy but nonetheless inviting sonic wilderness, produced by heavy tastemaker Matt Hyde (Slayer, Deftones, Hatebreed).<\/p>\r\n<p>Highway Crosses was made in collaboration with versatile Grammy-winning producer Warren Riker (Lauryn Hill, Santana, Michael Jackson), best known by metalheads for his work on the second and third albums by New Orleans supergroup DOWN and heavy slabs from Crowbar, Cynic, and the UK’s Cathedral. Songs like “Slow Season,” “Highway Crosses,” and “Felo De Se” mine the strengths of All Hail The Yeti’s already impressive catalog, with fresh vibrancy and raw ambition.<\/p>\r\n<p>“Slow Season” is a product of two different songs conceived for the album that were merged together, a lyrical contemplation about sanity and survival, when one finds themselves stranded alone. “Highway Crosses,” which like “Felo De Se” was co-written with Jorel Decker of Hollywood Undead, bucks All Hail The Yeti’s often unconventional structures for a more stripped-down almost Mötley Crüe style approach. Lyrically it’s the tale of a murderous lycanthrope that’s part An American Werewolf in London, part The Hitcher. Album closer “Nuclear Dust” is a continuation of sorts of “Nemesis Queen,” from the previous album, as 200-ft. tall killing machine monsters rule Earth.<\/p>\r\n<p>Heavy music adherents weaned on anything from Metallica and Pantera to metalcore, Southern groove, black metal, or stoner grind will find a home among the All Hail The Yeti faithful. Film fanatics who worship Stanley Kubrick and John Carpenter have reasons to celebrate Highway Crosses as well, as the songs are fashioned with similar analog angst and obsessive craftsmanship. Whether kicking back at the Bucket of Blood Saloon in Nevada or reading true crime books in Deadwood, ALL HAIL THE YETI is the perfect soundtrack for the outsider. If rock is a big beach bonfire, ALL HAIL THE YETI are the creeps huddled in the backwoods.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/all-hail-the-yeti\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=08cFFnxtAfI","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"all_hail_the_yeti_2023.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2023\/all_hail_the_yeti_2023.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27514}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2294,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/officialallhailtheyeti\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2295,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/allhailtheyeti\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Twitter","uid":2},"uid":2296,"uri":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/allhailtheyeti?lang=de"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"4LlFjUDKQwSQJPshq4MEpC","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/b\/1\/csm_all_hail_the_yeti_2023_dadf6c1d92.jpg","uid":783}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika","uid":220}],"pathSegment":"all-hail-the-yeti","title":"All Hail The Yeti","uid":38}],"end":"1691244900","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2560","subtitle":"","title":"Wasteland Stage","uid":11},"start":"1691242200","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1068},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"heriot","pid":176,"title":"Heriot","uid":558},"biography":"<p>Industrial soundscapes and ethereal vocals contrasting with HM-2 aggression creates an uncommon invention of metal.

Sie wissen doch, wie das bei mir läuft:&nbsp;<br \/> &nbsp;<br \/> Ich bringe ganz ganz frische Geschichten mit, nichts, was Sie vorab schon aus dem TV kennen, und zwischendurch erzähle ich Ihnen, was sonst noch war. Eine Führung durch die ganze Welt der Idiotie, die Einsicht, dass nichts menschlicher ist als das Missgeschick, seltsame Berichte vom Rand der schiefen Ebene, dann ergänze ich den Abend noch mit Schilderungen, die ich mir auf gar keinen Fall verkneifen kann, mache den Sack zum Ende hin mit einer sehr guten Geschichte zu, und wenn Sie dann noch können, hagelts Zugaben. Ein seriöses Konzept. &nbsp;Und ich gelobe, es sehr lustig zu gestalten.

Heimorgel in der Hip-Hop-Disco ?<br \/> Ganz klar – Mambo wollte auf die Bu¨hne, nur nicht so wie man es von ihm erwartet ha¨tte….<br \/> Kurzer Hand schmiedete er u¨ber Nacht einen Plan und zweckentfremdete das Instrument, um seinen Helden nacheifern zu ko¨nnen. Er hatte schon damals keine Scheu vor musikalischen Grenzen und interpretierte die Hits seiner Helden wie AC\/DC, Dr. Alban oder Rage against the Machine auf seiner heiß geliebten Heimorgel.<\/p>\r\n<p>Erst in den Tagen danach realisierte Mambo, dass er etwas Außergewo¨hnliches geschaffen haben musste, denn die Szene war hellauf begeistert. Mambos Neuinterpretationen auf der Heimorgel klangen besser als die Originale. Singen konnte Mambo zwar nicht, aber das war ihm und dem Publikum egal! Bei soviel Heimorgelpower ist ein bisschen schiefer Gesang reine Nebensache und aktuelle Chart-Hits auf einer Heimorgel nachzuspielen war sowieso eine absolute Weltpremiere!<\/p>\r\n<p>Der Rest ist Legende: Schnell gab es einen Major-Deal bei einer großen Plattenfirma und ein Engagement bei RTL. Mambo Kurt zelebrierte die hohe Kunst des Weglassens und Nichtsingenko¨nnens und entwickelte den Trash-Hype der Jahrtausendwende mit. Es dauerte nicht lange bis er auch die Hauptbu¨hnen der großen Festivals bestieg und sich allein mit seiner Orgel vor 45.000 Zuschauern wiederfand. 2004 spielte er zum ersten Mal in Wacken und entwickelte sich dort schnell zum Maskottchen des gro¨ßten Metal-Festivals der Welt. Von Skurrilita¨t getrieben ersetzte er nebenbei die Showband in der SWR Latenight Show , spielte auf Kreuzfahrt-Dampfern, erklomm einen 3.500m hohen Gipfel in den franzo¨sischen Alpen, um die Snowboardszene zu beglu¨cken und revolutionierte mit Team Rhythmusgymnastik den Ko¨lner Karneval – immer getreu seinem Motto :<\/p>\r\n<p>Umso absurder – Umso Besser<br \/> Alle wollen sie ihn sehen – den Orgelgott !!!<\/p>\r\n<p>Heute – 20 Jahre nach seinem ersten Bu¨hnenauftritt – begibt sich Mambo auf die lange Reise zu sich selbst. Er versucht zu verstehen, was eigentlich passiert ist….<br \/> Er resu¨miert, schreibt ein Buch, reist durch die Republik und besucht bekannte Ku¨nstler zum Kaffeeklatsch,<br \/> gemeinsamen Musizieren und Philosophieren.<\/p>\r\n<p>20 Jahre Heimorgel-Kult – Was war da passiert?<br \/> So richtig kann Mambo es selbst nicht verstehen, aber es gibt eine SPANNENDE Geschichte zu erza¨hlen!!!<br \/> In seiner Jubila¨ums-Show nimmt uns Mambo mit auf seine ganz perso¨nliche Reise.<br \/> Er erza¨hlt, singt, liest, tanzt und orgelt durch 20 Jahre Heimorgel-Kult.<br \/> Der Weg vom kleinen Mambo zum Terminator der Alleinunterhalter!

Ich zähle mich ohne rot zu werden zu den Menschen, die den Orgelgott abfeiern. \"King Of Heimorgel\" ist nunmehr das sechste Studioalbum des einzigartigen Alleinunterhalters und es gibt wie immer einzig und allein den Sound seiner Electone D85 Heimorgel und seinen unvergleichlichen Gesang zu hören. Der Gesang ist nach objektiven Standpunkten natürlich wieder unglaublich beschissen, aber gerade das macht eine Mambo Kurt Platte doch aus. Dieses teils unglaublich neben der Spur liegende, aber doch nie uninspiriert wirkende Genöle... herrlich. Nicht unerwähnt bleiben darf natürlich der Gastgesang von Orgellehrerin Heidi Schulz, die mal wieder noch schlechter singt, als der Chef selbst (man höre sich \"Rhythm Is A Dancer\" an!!!). Am Konzept hat sich, Gott sei Dank nichts geändert. Mambo interpretiert Hits aus Rock, Pop und Metal auf seine ihm unnachahmliche Art und Weise auf...? natürlich der Heimorgel. Ob Motörheads \"Ace Of Spades\", Lady Gagas \"Pokerface\" oder System Of A Downs \"Chop Suey\", hier ist nichts sicher; heilig aber schon, denn man merkt den Stücken allesamt an, dass stets mit dem nötigen Respekt an sie heran gegangen wurde. Vanilla Ice' \"Ice Ice Baby\" klingt in der Orgelversion sogar wesentlich cooler als im Original. Mehr Titel möchte ich aber bewusst nicht verraten, ist das Schmunzeln doch noch größer, wenn die Songs überraschend kommen. \"King Of Heimorgel\" ist auf jeden Fall erneut ein Pflichtkauf für alle Fans schräger Coverversionen. Fans des Meisters müssen sowieso zuschlagen. (Rezension: David Lang)<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"bodytext\">Was erwartet den geneigten Zuschauer live? Ein Alleinunterhalter mit einer Heimorgel spielt Coverversionen von Songs, die man nie an einer Heimorgel erwartet hätte. Hardrock- und Popklassiker erhalten einen ganz eigenen Stil und es groovt gewaltig. Die Heimorgel fährt mit ihren herrlichen Plastiksounds sofort in das Tanzbein und macht Mambo-Kurt-Fans von den ersten Takten an glücklich. Dazu kommen manchmal sinnentleerte, manchmal aber auch hochgeistige Zwischeneinlagen des Meisters, es fiept, es rockt. Weltspitzenklasse. Mambo ist der einzige, bei dem nach „Slayer“ „Dr. Alban“ kommen darf, und nach „Abba“ „Rage against the Machine“, ohne dass irgendjemand an der Richtigkeit zweifeln würde. Ein Mambo-Kurt-Konzert ist erst dann gelungen, wenn es ein Stagediving und eine Polonaise gab, und bis jetzt hat es immer geklappt.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"bodytext\">Mambo Kurt war 1982 westdeutscher Meister im Heimorgelspielen in der Altersgruppe der bis 14jährigen. Ende der 90er bot er zum ersten Mal im kleinen Kreis Coversongs auf der Heimorgel dar. Sofort fand sich in Heavy-Metal Kreisen eine große Fangemeinde, da Mambo eine Vorliebe für Rocksongs hat. Legendär ist seine „Enter Sandman“ Version als Walzer. Der Trash-Hype der Jahrtausendwende spülte Mambo ins TV, zu RTL und VIVA2, um genau zu sein. Es folgte ein Engagement am Schauspielhaus Hannover in 2003 und eine Komponistentätigkeit für ARTE. Im Jahre 2006 war Mambo als Fanbotschafter für die ARD bei der FIFA WM unterwegs. Als Vorsitzender der deutsch-holländischen Fussballfreundschaft, brachte er das Kunststück fertig, jeweils eine WM-Single in Deutschland und Holland zu veröffentlichen. 2005 war Mambo der Moderator von „Rock-Guerilla“ bei „ROCKHARD“. Seit 2006 ist Mambo Kurt einmal die Woche als kleinste Studioband der Welt in der SWR latenight Show im TV zu sehen. 2011 bespasste er „STERN-TV“ auf RTL und Sondersendungen zu Grandprix und Frauen-WM im ZDF.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"bodytext\">Der Terminator unter den Alleinunterhaltern is back, Mambo trennt die Massen schneller als Moses das Meer, liebt ihn oder hasst ihn. Er ist der „King of Heimorgel“.<\/p>","detailLink":"\/de\/programm\/bands\/band\/mambo-kurt\/","externalMediaRatio":"16by9","externalMediaSource":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jeYRLtX5tEQ","extraDay":false,"festival":{"runningOrderActive":true,"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"firsttime":false,"images":[{"originalResource":{"alternative":null,"description":null,"name":"mambo_kurt_2020.jpg","publicUrl":"fileadmin\/user_upload\/bandimages\/bands2020\/mambo_kurt_2020.jpg","title":null,"type":2,"uid":27897}}],"isExtraDay":false,"isFirsttime":false,"networkuri":[{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Homepage","uid":8},"uid":2515,"uri":"https:\/\/mambokurt.de\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Facebook","uid":1},"uid":2516,"uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mambokurtoffiziell\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Instagram","uid":5},"uid":2517,"uri":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mamboookurt\/"},{"socialnetwork":{"title":"Youtube","uid":6},"uid":2518,"uri":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/Orgelgott"}],"pid":176,"spotifyalbum":"","spotifyartist":"29t2xhTM0SRjm8iTNVMynh","subtitle":"","thumbnail":"\/fileadmin\/_processed_\/0\/0\/csm_mambo_kurt_2020_28e263a0e0.jpg","uid":847}],"country":[{"nameLocalized":"Deutschland","uid":54}],"pathSegment":"mambo-kurt","title":"Mambo Kurt","uid":203}],"end":"1691260200","festival":{"title":"WOA 2023","uid":7},"festivalday":{"end":"1691283600","start":"1691215200","title":"Saturday","uid":16},"images":null,"media":null,"performance":{"title":"Concert","uid":1},"stage":{"description":"","latitude":"","longitude":"","pid":167,"sorting":"2688","subtitle":"","title":"Welcome To The Jungle","uid":13},"start":"1691256600","subtitle":"","sysLanguageUid":"-1","teaser":"","title":"","uid":1114},{"artists":[{"assets":[{"artist":{"origUid":null,"pathSegment":"alien-rockin-explosion","pid":176,"title":"Alien Rockin Explosion","uid":229},"biography":"<p>ALIEN ROCKIN’ EXPLOSION (A.R.E) is much more than a rock band.
